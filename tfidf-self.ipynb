Is it an unskillful bodily act, with painful consequences, painful results?' If, on reflection, you know that it would lead to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it would be an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences, painful results, then any bodily act of that sort is absolutely unfit for you to do. But if on reflection you know that it would not cause affliction... it would be a skillful bodily act with happy consequences, happy results, then any bodily act of that sort is fit for you to do.(Similarly with verbal acts & mental acts.)\"While you are performing a bodily act, you should reflect on it: 'This bodily act I am doing — is it leading to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both? Is it an unskillful bodily act, with painful consequences, painful results?' If, on reflection, you know that it is leading to self-affliction, to affliction of others, or both... you should give it up. But if on reflection you know that it is not... you may continue with it.(Similarly with verbal acts & mental acts.)\"Having performed a bodily act, you should reflect on it... If, on reflection, you know that it led to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it was an unskillful bodily act with painful consequences, painful results, then you should confess it, reveal it, lay it open to the Teacher or to a knowledgeable companion in the holy life. Having confessed it... you should exercise restraint in the future. But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction... it was a skillful bodily act with happy consequences, happy results, then you should stay mentally refreshed & joyful, training day & night in skillful mental qualities.(Similarly with verbal acts.)\"Having performed a mental act, you should reflect on it... If, on reflection, you know that it led to self-affliction, to the affliction of others, or to both; it was an unskillful mental act with painful consequences, painful results, then you should feel horrified, humiliated, & disgusted with it. Feeling horrified... you should exercise restraint in the future. But if on reflection you know that it did not lead to affliction... it was a skillful mental act with happy consequences, happy results, then you should stay mentally refreshed & joyful, training day & night in skillful mental qualities.\"Rahula, all the brahmans & contemplatives in the course of the past who purified their bodily acts, verbal acts, & mental acts, did it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts, verbal acts, & mental acts in just this way.\"All the brahmans & contemplatives in the course of the future... All the brahmans & contemplatives at present who purify their bodily acts, verbal acts, & mental acts, do it through repeated reflection on their bodily acts, verbal acts, & mental acts in just this way.\"And so, Rahula, you should train yourself: 'I will purify my bodily acts through repeated reflection. I will purify my verbal acts through repeated reflection. I will purify my mental acts through repeated reflection.' That's how you should train yourself.\"That is what the Blessed One said.

Those overhead in the grove are far more numerous.\"\"In the same way, monks, those things that I have known with direct knowledge but have not taught are far more numerous than the things I have taught.

There are some cases in which a person overcome with pain, his mind exhausted, grieves, mourns, laments, beats his breast, & becomes bewildered. Or one overcome with pain, his mind exhausted, comes to search outside, 'Who knows a way or two to stop this pain?' I tell you, monks, that stress results either in bewilderment or in search.\"And what is the cessation of stress?

In the same way, these four frames of reference are bindings for the awareness of the disciple of the noble ones, for the sake of overcoming his household habits, overcoming his household memories & resolves, overcoming his distraction, fatigue, & fever over leaving the household life, for the attainment of the right method and the realization of Unbinding.\"Then the Tathagata trains him further: \"Come, monk, remain focused on the body in & of itself, but do not think any thoughts connected with the body.

Hence, those with whom he agrees as to the Tao have the happiness   of attaining to it; those with whom he agrees as to its manifestation   have the happiness of attaining to it; and those with whom he agrees   in their failure have also the happiness of attaining (to the Tao).

Only he who has a co-ordinated understanding of both the visible and the invisible, of matter and spirit, of activity and that which is behind activity, conquers Nature and thus overcomes death.  By work, by making the mind steady and by following the prescribed rules given in the Scriptures, a man gains wisdom.  By the light of that wisdom he is able to perceive the Invisible Cause in all visible forms. Therefore the wise man sees Him in every manifested form.  They who have a true conception of God are never separated from Him.  They exist in Him and He in them.   \n",

      " The face of Truth is hidden by a golden disk.  O Pushan (Effulgent Being)!  Uncover (Thy face) that I, the worshipper of Truth, may behold Thee.   \n",
      "2.16\n",
      " O Pushan!  O Sun, sole traveller of the heavens, controller of all, son of Prajapati, withdraw Thy rays and gather up Thy burning effulgence.  Now through Thy Grace I behold Thy blessed and glorious form.  The Purusha (Effulgent Being) who dwells within Thee, I am He.  Here the sun, who is the giver of all light, is used as the symbol of the Infinite, giver of all wisdom.  The seeker after Truth prays to the Effulgent One to control His dazzling rays, that his eyes, no longer blinded by them, may behold the Truth.  Having perceived It, he proclaims: \"Now I see that that Effulgent Being and I are one and the same, and my delusion is destroyed.\" By the light of Truth he is able to discriminate between the real and the unreal, and the knowledge thus gained convinces him that he is one with the Supreme; that there is no difference between himself and the Supreme Truth; or as Christ said, \"I and my Father are one.\"   \n",

      " May my life-breath go to the all-pervading and immortal Prana, and let this body be burned to ashes.  Om!  O mind, remember thy deeds!  O mind, remember, remember thy deeds!  Remember!  Seek not fleeting results as the reward of thy actions, O mind!  Strive only for the Imperishable.  This Mantram or text is often chanted at the hour of death to remind one of the perishable nature of the body and the eternal nature of the Soul.  When the clear vision of the distinction between the mortal body and the immortal Soul dawns in the heart, then all craving for physical pleasure or material possession drops away; and one can say, let the body be burned to ashes that the Soul may attain its freedom; for death is nothing more than the casting-off of a worn-out garment.   \n",

      " Vahasrava, being desirous of heavenly rewards (at the Viswajit sacrifice), made a gift of all that he possessed.  He had a son by the name of Nachiketas.   \n",
      "2.19\n",
      " When the offerings were being distributed, faith (Shraddha) entered (the heart of) Nachiketas, who, though young, yet resected:   \n",
      "2.20\n",
      " These cows have drunk water, eaten grass and given milk for the last time, and their senses have lost all vigour.  He who gives these undoubtedly goes to joyless realms.  In India the idea of sacrifice has always been to give freely for the joy of giving, without asking anything in return; and the whole purpose and merit of the sacrifice is lost, if the giver entertains the least thought of name, fame or individual benefit.  The special Viswajit sacrifice which Vajasrava was making required of him to give away all that he possessed.  When, however, the gifts were brought forward to be offered, his son Nachiketas, although probably a lad about twelve years of age, observed how worthless were the animals which his father was offering.  His heart at once became filled with Shraddha.  There is no one English word which can convey the meaning of this Sanskrit term.  It is more than mere faith.  It also implies self-reliance, an independent sense of right and wrong, and the courage of one's own conviction. As a boy of tender age, Nachiketas had no right to question his father's action; yet, impelled by the sudden awakening of his higher nature, he could not but reflect: \"By merely giving these useless cows, my father cannot gain any merit.  If he has vowed to give all his possessions, then he must also give me.  Otherwise his sacrifice will not be complete and fruitful.\" Therefore, anxious for his father's welfare, he approached him gently and reverently.   \n",
      "2.21\n",
      " He said to his father: Dear father, to whom wilt thou give me? He said it a second time, then a third time.  The father replied: I shall give thee unto Death.  Nachiketas, being a dutiful son and eager to atone for his father's inadequate sacrifice, tried to remind him thus indirectly that he had not fulfilled his promise to give away all his possessions, since he had not yet offered his own son, who would be a worthier gift than useless cattle.  His father, conscious that he was not making a true sacrifice, tried to ignore the boy's questions; but irritated by his persistence, he at last impatiently made answer: \"I give thee to Yama, the Lord of Death.\"  The fact that anger could so quickly rise in his heart proved that he had not the proper attitude of a sacrificer, who must always be tranquil, uplifted and free from egoism.   \n",
      "2.22\n",
      " Nachiketas thought: Among many (of my father's pupils) I stand first; among many (others) I stand in the middle (but never last). What will be accomplished for my father by my going this day to Yama?  It was not conceit which led Nachiketas to consider his own standing and importance.  He was weighing his value as a son and pupil in order to be able to judge whether or not he had merit enough to prove a worthy gift.  Although he realized that his father's harsh reply was only the expression of a momentary outburst of anger; yet he believed that greater harm might befall his father, if his word was not kept.  Therefore he sought to strengthen his father's resolution by reminding him of the transitory condition of life. He said:   \n",
      "2.23\n",
      " Look back to those who lived before and look to those who live now.  Like grain the mortal decays and like grain again springs up (is reborn).  All things perish, Truth alone remains.  Why then fear to sacrifice me also; Thus Nachiketas convinced his father that he should remain true to his word and send him to Yama, the Ruler of Death.  Then Nachiketas went to the abode of Death, but Yama was absent and the boy waited without food or drink for three days.  On Yama's return one of his household said to him:   \n",
      "2.24\n",
      " Like fire a Brahmana guest enters into houses.  That fire is quenched by an offering.  (Therefore) O Vaivaswata, bring water.   \n",
      "2.25\n",
      " The foolish man in whose house a Brahmana guest remains without food, all his hopes and expectations, all the merit gained by his association with the holy, by his good words and deeds, all his sons and cattle, are destroyed.  According to the ancient Vedic ideal a guest is the representative of God and should be received with due reverence and honor.  Especially is this the case with a Brahmana or a Sannyasin whose life is wholly consecrated to God.  Any one who fails to give proper care to a holy guest brings misfortune on himself and his household.  When Yama returned, therefore, one of the members of his household anxiously informed him of Nachiketas' presence and begged him to bring water to wash his feet, this being always the first service to an arriving guest.   \n",
      "2.26\n",
      " Yama said: O Brahmana!  Revered guest!  My salutations to thee. As thou hast remained three nights in my house without food, therefore choose three boons, O Brahmana.   \n",
      "2.27\n",
      " Nachiketas said: May Gautama, my father, be free from anxious thought (about me).  May he lose all anger (towards me) and be pacified in heart.  May he know and welcome me when I am sent back by thee.  This, O Death, is the first of the three boons I choose.   \n",
      "2.28\n",
      " Yama replied: Through my will Auddalaki Aruni (thy father) will know thee, and be again towards thee as before.  He will sleep in peace at night.  He will be free from wrath when he sees thee released from the mouth of death.  \n",
      "2.29\n",
      " Nachiketas said: In the realm of heaven there is no fear, thou (Death) art not there; nor is there fear of old age.  Having crossed beyond both hunger and thirst and being above grief, (they) rejoice in heaven.   \n",
      "2.30\n",
      " Thou knowest, O Death, the fire-sacrifice that leads to heaven. Tell this to me, who am full of Shraddha (faith and yearning). They who live in the realm of heaven enjoy freedom from death. This I beg as my second boon.   \n",
      "2.31\n",
      " Yama replied: I know well that fire which leads to the realm of heaven.  I shall tell it to thee.  Listen to me.  Know, O Nachiketas, that this is the means of attaining endless worlds and their support.  It is hidden in the heart of all beings.   \n",
      "2.32\n",
      " Yama then told him that fire-sacrifice, the beginning of all the worlds; what bricks, how many and how laid for the altar. Nachiketas repeated all as it was told to him.  Then Death, being pleased with him, again said:   \n",
      "2.33\n",
      " The great-soured Yama, being well pleased, said to him (Nachiketas): I give thee now another boon.  This fire (sacrifice) shall be named after thee.  Take also this garland of many colours.   \n",
      "2.34\n",
      " He who performs this Nachiketa fire-sacrifice three times, being united with the three (mother, father and teacher), and who fulfills the three-fold duty (study of the Vedas, sacrifice and alms-giving) crosses over birth and death.  Knowing this worshipful shining fire, born of Brahman, and realizing Him, he attains eternal peace.   \n",
      "2.35\n",
      " He who knows the three-fold Nachiketa fire and performs the Nachiketa fire-sacrifice with three-fold knowledge, having cast off the fetters of death and being beyond grief, he rejoices in the realm of heaven.   \n",
      "2.36\n",
      " O Nachiketas, this is thy fire that leads to heaven, which thou hast chosen as thy second boon.  People will call this fire after thy name.  Ask the third boon, Nachiketas.  Fire is regarded as \"the foundation of all the worlds,\" because it is the revealer of creation.  If there were no fire or light, no manifested form would be visible.  We read in the Semitic Scriptures, \"In the beginning the Lord said, 'Let there be light.\"'  Therefore, that which stands in the external universe as one of the purest symbols of the Divine, also dwells in subtle form in the heart of every living being as the vital energy, the life-force or cause of existence.  Yama now tells Nachiketas how, by performing sacrifice with the three-fold knowledge, he may transcend grief and death and reach heaven.  The three-fold knowledge referred to is regarding the preparation of the altar and fire.  Nachiketas being eager to learn, listened with wholehearted attention and was able to repeat all that was told him.  This so pleased Yama that he granted him the extra boon of naming the fire-sacrifice after him and gave him a garland set with precious stones.  Verses XVI-XVIII are regarded by many as an interpolation, which would account for certain obscurities and repetitions in them.   \n",
      "2.37\n",
      " Nachiketas said: There is this doubt regarding what becomes of a man after death.  Some say he exists, others that he does not exist.  This knowledge I desire, being instructed by thee.  Of the boons this is the third boon.   \n",
      "2.38\n",
      " Yama replied: Even the Devas (Bright Ones) of old doubted regarding this.  It is not easy to know; subtle indeed is this subject.  O Nachiketas, choose another boon.  Do not press me. Ask not this boon of me.   \n",
      "2.39\n",
      " Nachiketas said: O Death, thou sayest that even the Devas had doubts about this, and that it is not easy to know.  Another teacher like unto thee is not to be found.  Therefore no other boon can be equal to this one.  \n",
      "2.40\n",
      " Yama said: Ask for sons and grandsons who shall live a hundred years, many cattle, elephants, gold and horses.  Ask for lands of vast extent and live thyself as many autumns as thou desirest.   \n",
      "2.41\n",
      " If thou thinkest of any other boon equal to this, ask for wealth and long life; be ruler over the wide earth.  O Nachiketas, I shall make thee enjoyer of all desires.   \n",
      "2.42\n",
      " Whatsoever objects of desire are difficult to obtain in the realm of mortals, ask them all as thou desirest; these lovely maidens with their chariots and musical instruments, such as are not obtainable by mortals--be served by these whom I give to thee.  O Nachiketas, do not ask regarding death.  The third boon asked by Nachiketas concerning the great Hereafter was one which could be granted only to those who were freed from all mortal desires and limitations, therefore Yama first tested Nachiketas to see whether he was ready to receive such knowledge.  \"Do not press me regarding this secret,\" he said.  \"Even wise men cannot understand it and thou art a mere lad.  Take, rather, long life, wealth, whatever will give thee happiness on the mortal plane.\"  But the boy proved his strength and worthiness by remaining firm in his resolution to know the great secret of life and death.   \n",
      "2.43\n",
      " Nachiketas said: O Death, these are fleeting; they weaken the vigour of all the senses in man.  Even the longest life is short. Keep thou thy chariots, dance and music.   \n",
      "2.44\n",
      " Man cannot be satisfied by wealth.  Shall we possess wealth when we see thee (Death)?  Shall we continue to live as long as thou rulest?  Therefore that boon alone is to be chosen by me.   \n",
      "2.45\n",
      " What man dwelling on the decaying mortal plane, having approached the undecaying immortal one, and having reflected upon the nature of enjoyment through beauty and sense pleasure, would delight in long life?   \n",
      "2.46\n",
      " Yama said: The good is one thing and the pleasant another.  These two, having different ends, bind a man.  It is well with him who chooses the good.  He who chooses the pleasant misses the true end.   \n",
      "2.47\n",
      " The good and the pleasant approach man; the wise examines both and discriminates between them; the wise prefers the good to the pleasant, but the foolish man chooses the pleasant through love of bodily pleasure.   \n",
      "2.48\n",
      " O Nachiketas after wise reflection thou hast renounced the pleasant and all pleasing forms.  Thou hast not accepted this garland of great value for which many mortals perish.   \n",
      "2.49\n",
      " Wide apart are these two,--ignorance and what is known as wisdom, leading in opposite directions.  I believe Nachiketas to be one who longs for wisdom, since many tempting objects have not turned thee aside.  With this second part, the Ruler of Death begins his instructions regarding the great Hereafter.  There are two paths,--one leading Godward, the other leading to worldly pleasure.  He who follows one inevitably goes away from the other; because, like light and darkness they conflict.  One leads to the imperishable spiritual realm; the other to the perishable physical realm. Both confront a man at every step of life.  The discerning man distinguishing between the two, chooses the Real and Eternal, and he alone attains the highest, while the ignorant man, preferring that which brings him immediate and tangible results, misses the true purpose of his existence.  Although Yama put before Nachiketas many temptations to test his sincerity and earnestness, he judging them at their real value, refused them all, saying \"I have come from the mortal realm, shall I ask for what is mortal?  I desire only that which is eternal.\"  Then Death said to him: \"I now see that thou art a sincere desirer of Truth.  I offered thee vast wealth, long life and every form of pleasure which tempts and deludes men; but thou hast proved thy worthiness by rejecting them all.\"   \n",
      "2.50\n",
      " Fools dwelling in ignorance, yet imagining themselves wise and learned, go round and round in crooked ways, like the blind led by the blind.   \n",
      "2.51\n",
      " The Hereafter never rises before the thoughtless child (the ignorant), deluded by the glamour of wealth.  \"This world alone is, there is none other\": thinking thus, he falls under my sway again and again.  There are many in the world, who, puffed up with intellectual conceit, believe that they are capable of guiding others.  But although they may possess a certain amount of worldly wisdom, they are devoid of deeper understanding; therefore all that they say merely increases doubt and confusion in the minds of those who hear them.  Hence they are likened to blind men leading the blind.  The Hereafter does not shine before those who are lacking in the power of discrimination and are easily carried away therefore by the charm of fleeting objects.  As children are tempted by toys, so they are tempted by pleasure, power, name and fame.  To them these seem the only realities.  Being thus attached to perishable things, they come many times under the dominion of death.  There is one part of us which must die; there is another part which never dies.  When a man can identify himself with his undying nature, which is one with God, then he overcomes death.   \n",
      "2.52\n",
      " He about whom many are not even able to hear, whom many cannot comprehend even after hearing: wonderful is the teacher, wonderful is he who can receive when taught by an able teacher.  Throughout the Vedic Scriptures it is declared that no one can impart spiritual knowledge unless he has realization.  What is meant by realization? It means knowledge based on direct perception.  In India often the best teachers have no learning, but their character is so shining that every one learns merely by coming in contact with them.  In one of the Scriptures we read: Under a banyan tree sat a youthful teacher and beside him an aged disciple.  The mind of the disciple was full of doubts and questions, but although the teacher continued silent, gradually every doubt vanished from the disciple's mind.  This signifies that the conveying of spiritual teaching does not depend upon words only.  It is the life, the illumination, which counts. Such God-enlightened men, however, cannot easily be found; but even with such a teacher, the knowledge of the Self cannot be gained unless the heart of the disciple is open and ready for the Truth.  Hence Yama says both teacher and taught must be wonderful.   \n",

      " When taught by a man of inferior understanding, this Atman cannot be truly known, even though frequently thought upon.  There is no way (to know It) unless it is taught by another (an illumined teacher), for it is subtler than the subtle and beyond argument.   \n",
      "2.54\n",
      " O Dearest, this Atman cannot be attained by argument; It is truly known only when taught by another (a wise teacher).  O Nachiketas, thou hast attained It.  Thou art fixed in Truth.  May we ever, find a questioner like thee.  Knowledge of the Atman or Self cannot be attained when it is taught by those who themselves lack in real understanding of It; and who therefore, having no definite conviction of their own, differ among themselves as to its nature and existence.  Only he who has been able to perceive the Self directly, through the unfoldment of his higher nature, can proclaim what It actually is; and his words alone carry weight and bring illumination.  It is too subtle to be reached by argument.  This secret regarding the Hereafter cannot be known through reasoning or mere intellectual gymnastics.  It is to be attained only in a state of consciousness which transcends the boundary line of reason.   \n",
      "2.55\n",
      " I know that (earthly) treasure is transitory, for the eternal can never be attained by things which are non-eternal.  Hence the Nachiketa fire (sacrifice) has been performed by me with perishable things and yet I have attained the eternal.   \n",
      "2.56\n",
      " O Nachiketas, thou hast seen the fulfillment of all desires, the basis of the universe, the endless fruit of sacrificial rites, the other shore where there is no fear, that which is praiseworthy, the great and wide support; yet, being wise, thou hast rejected all with firm resolve.  The teacher, saying that the imperishable cannot be attained by the perishable, shows that no amount of observance of rituals and ceremonies can earn the imperishable and eternal.  Although the Nachiketa fire-sacrifice may bring results which seem eternal to mortals because of their long duration, yet they too must come to an end; therefore this sacrifice cannot lead to the final goal.  Yama praises Nachiketas because, when all heavenly and earthly pleasures, as well as knowledge of all realms and their enjoyments were offered him, yet he cast them aside and remained firm in his desire for Truth alone.   \n",
      "2.57\n",
      " The wise, who by means of the highest meditation on the Self knows the Ancient One, difficult to perceive, seated in the innermost recess, hidden in the cave of the heart, dwelling in the depth of inner being, (he who knows that One) as God, is liberated from the fetters of joy and sorrow.   \n",
      "2.58\n",
      " A mortal, having heard and fully grasped this, and having realized through discrimination the subtle Self, rejoices, because he has obtained that which is the source of all joy. I think the abode (of Truth) is open to Nachiketas.  The Scriptures give three stages in all spiritual attainment.  The aspirant must first hear about the Truth from an enlightened teacher; next he must reflect upon what he has heard; then by constant practice of discrimination and meditation he realizes it; and with realization comes the fulfilment of every desire, because it unites him with the source of all.  Having beheld this, a man learns that all sense pleasures are but fragmentary reflections of that one supreme joy, which can be found in the true Self alone.  Yama assures Nachiketas that there is no doubt of his realizing the Truth, because he has shown the highest discrimination as well as fixity of purpose.   \n",

      " Yama replied: That goal which all the Vedas glorify, which all austerities proclaim, desiring which (people) practice Brahmacharya (a life of continence and service), that goal I tell thee briefly--it is Aum.  What name can man give to God?  How can the Infinite be bound by any finite word?  All that language can express must be finite, since it is itself finite.  Yet it is very difficult for mortals to think or speak of anything without calling it by a definite name.  Knowing this, the Sages gave to the Supreme the name A-U-M which stands as the root of all language.  The first letter \"A\" is the mother-sound, being the natural sound uttered by every creature when the throat is opened, and no sound can be made without opening the throat.  The last letter \"M,\" spoken by closing the lips, terminates all articulation.  As one carries the sound from the throat to the lips, it passes through the sound \"U.\"  These three sounds therefore cover the whole field of possible articulate sound.  Their combination is called the Akshara or the imperishable word, the Sound-Brahman or the Word God, because it is the most universal name which can be given to the Supreme. Hence it must be the word which was \"in the beginning\" and corresponds to the Logos of Christian theology. It is because of the all-embracing significance of this name that it is used so universally in the Vedic Scriptures to designate the Absolute.   \n",

      " The Self is subtler than the subtle, greater than the great; It dwells in the heart of each living being.  He who is free from desire and free from grief, with mind and senses tranquil, beholds the glory of the Atman.  Although this Atman dwells in the heart of every living being, yet It is not perceived by ordinary mortals because of Its subtlety.  It cannot be perceived by the senses; a finer spiritual sight is required.  The heart must be pure and freed from every unworthy selfish desire; the thought must be indrawn from all external objects; mind and body must be under control; when the whole being thus becomes calm and serene, then it is possible to perceive that effulgent Atman.  It is subtler than the subtle, because It is the invisible essence of every thing; and It is greater than the great because It is the boundless, sustaining power of the whole universe; that upon which all existence rests.   \n",
      "2.66\n",
      " Though sitting, It travels far; though lying, It goes everywhere. Who else save me is fit to know that God, who is (both) joyful and joyless?  The Self is all-pervading, hence It is that which sits still and that which travels, that which is active and that which is inactive.  It is both stationary and moving, and It is the basis of all forms of existence; therefore whatever exists in the universe, whether joy or joylessness, pleasure or pain, must spring from It.  Who is better able to know God than I myself, since He resides in my heart and is the very essence of my being? Such should be the attitude of one who is seeking.   \n",
      "2.67\n",
      " The wise who know the Self, bodiless, seated within perishable bodies, great and all- pervading, grieve not.  Then a wise man through the practice of discrimination has seen clearly the distinction between body and Soul, he knows that his true Self is not the body, though It dwells in the body.  Thus realizing the indestructible, all-pervading nature of his real Self, he surmounts all fear of death or loss, and is not moved even by the greatest sorrow.   \n",

      " This Self cannot be attained by study of the Scriptures, nor by intellectual perception, nor by frequent hearing (of It); He whom the Self chooses, by him alone is It attained.  To him the Self reveals Its true nature.  We may imagine that by much study we can find out God; but merely hearing about a thing and gaining an intellectual comprehension of it does not mean attaining true knowledge of it.  Knowledge only comes through direct perception, and direct perception of God is possible for those alone who are pure in heart and spiritually awakened.  Although He is alike to all beings and His mercy is on all, yet the impure and worldy-minded do not get the blessing, because they do not know how to open their hearts to it.  He who longs for God, him the Lord chooses; because to him alone can He reveal His true nature.   \n",

      " He who has not turned away from evil conduct, whose senses are uncontrolled, who is not tranquil, whose mind is not at rest, he can never attain this Atman even by knowledge.  Yama having first described what the Atman is, now tells us how to attain It. A man must try to subdue his lower nature and gain control over the body and senses.  He must conquer the impure selfish desires which now disturb the serenity of his mind, that it may grow calm and peaceful. In other words, he must live the life and develop all spiritual qualities in order to perceive the Atman.   \n",

The knowers of Brahman call them shadow and light.  So also (they are called) by householders who perform five fire- sacrifices or three Nachiketa fire-sacrifices.  Here the two signify the Higher Self and the lower self, dwelling in the innermost cave of the heart.  The Seers of Truth, as well as householders who follow the path of rituals and outer forms with the hope of enjoying the fruits of their good deeds, both proclaim that the Higher Self is like a light and the lower self like a shadow.  When the Truth shines clearly in the heart of the knower, then he surmounts the apparent duality of his nature and becomes convinced that there is but One, and that all outer manifestations are nothing but reflections or projections of that One.   \n",

May we also know the One, who is the highest imperishable Brahman for those who desire to cross over to the other shore which is beyond fear.  The significance of this text is May we acquire the knowledge of Brahman, the Supreme, in both manifested and unmanifested form.  He is manifested as the Lord of sacrifice for those who follow the path of ritual. He is the unmanifested, eternal, universal Supreme Being for those who follow the path of wisdom.  The \"other shore,\" being the realm of immortality, is said to be beyond fear; because disease, death, and all that which mortals fear, cease to exist there.  It is believed by many that these two opening verses were a later interpolation.   \n",

      " The senses are called the horses; the sense objects are the roads; when the Atman is united with body, senses and mind, then the wise call Him the enjoyer.  In the third chapter Yama defines what part of our being dies and what part is deathless, what is mortal and what is immortal.  But the Atman, the Higher Self, is so entirely beyond human conception that it is impossible to give a direct definition of It.  Only through similies can some idea of It be conveyed.  That is the reason why all the great Teachers of the world have so often taught in the form of parables.  So here the Ruler of Death represents the Self as the lord of this chariot of the body.  The intellect or discriminative faculty is the driver, who controls these wild horses of the senses by holding firmly the reins of the mind.  The roads over which these horses travel are made up of all the external objects which attract or repel the senses:--the sense of smelling follows the path of sweet odours, the sense of seeing the way of beautiful sights.  Thus each sense, unless restrained by the discriminative faculty, seeks to go out towards its special objects.  When the Self is joined with body, mind and senses, It is called the intelligent enjoyer; because It is the one who wills, feels, perceives and does everything.   \n",

The man whose intellect is not discriminative and who fails to distinguish right from wrong, the real from the unreal, is carried away by his sense passions and desires, just as a driver is carried away by vicious horses over which he has lost control.  But he who clearly distinguishes what is good from what is merely pleasant, and controls all his out-going forces from running after apparent momentary pleasures, his senses obey and serve him as good horses obey their driver.   \n",

A driver must possess first a thorough knowledge of the road; next he must understand how to handle the reins and control his horses.  Then will he drive safely to his destination.  Similarly in this journey of life, our mind and senses must be wholly under the control of our higher discriminative faculty; for only when all our forces work in unison can we hope to reach the goal--the abode of Absolute Truth.   \n",

      " Beyond the great Atman is the Unmanifested; beyond the Unmanifested is the Purusha (the Cosmic Soul); beyond the Purusha there is nothing.  That is the end, that is the final goal.  In these two verses the Teacher shows the process of discrimination, by which one attains knowledge of the subtle Self.  Beginning with the sense-organs, he leads up to the less and less gross, until he reaches that which is subtlest of all, the true Self of man.  The senses are dependent on sense-objects, because without these the senses would have no utility.  Superior to sense-objects is the mind, because unless these objects affect the mind, they cannot influence the senses.  Over the mind the determinative faculty exercises power; this determinative faculty is governed by the individual Self; beyond this Self is the undifferentiated creative energy known as Avyaktam; and above this is the Purusha or Supreme Self.  Than this there is nothing higher.  That is the goal, the Highest Abode of Peace and Bliss.   \n",

      " This Atman (Self), hidden in all beings, does not shine forth; but It is seen by subtle seers through keen and subtle understanding.  If It dwells in all living beings, why do we not see It? Because the ordinary man's vision is too dull and distracted.  It is visible to those alone whose intellect has been purified by constant thought on the Supreme, and whose sight therefore has become refined and sharpened.  This keenness of vision comes only when all our forces have been made one-pointed through steadfast practice of concentration and meditation.  \n",

      " A wise man should control speech by mind, mind by intellect, intellect by the great Atman, and that by the Peaceful One (the Paramatman or Supreme Self).  Here Yama gives the practical method to be followed if one wishes to realize the Supreme.  The word \"speech\" stands for all the senses.  First, therefore, a man must control his outgoing senses by the mind.  Then the mind must be brought under the control of the discriminative faculty; that is, it must be withdrawn from all sense-objects and cease to waste its energies on nonessential things.  The discriminative faculty in turn must be controlled by the higher individual intelligence and this must be governed wholly by the Supreme Intelligence.  \n",

Invoke their blessing with a humble spirit and seek to be instructed by them.  The path is very difficult to tread.  No thoughtless or lethargic person can safely travel on it.

      " Knowing That which is soundless, touchless, formless, undecaying; also tasteless, odorless, and eternal; beginningless, endless and immutable; beyond the Unmanifested: (knowing That) man escapes from the mouth of death.  The Ruler of Death defines here the innermost essence of our being.  Because of its extreme subtlety, it cannot be heard or felt or smelled or tasted like any ordinary object.  It never dies.  It has no beginning or end.  It is unchangeable.  Realizing this Supreme Reality, man escapes from death and attains everlasting life.  Thus the Teacher has gradually led Nachiketas to a point where he can reveal to him the secret of death.  The boy had thought that there was a place where he could stay and become immortal.  But Yama shows him that immortality is a state of consciousness and is not gained so long as man clings to name and form, or to perishable objects.  What dies? Form.  Therefore the formful man dies; but not that which dwells within. Although inconceivably subtle, the Sages have always made an effort through similies and analogies to give some idea of this inner Self or the God within. They have described It as beyond mind and speech; too subtle for ordinary perception, but not beyond the range of purified vision.   \n",

Some wise man, however, desiring immortality, with eyes turned away (from the external) sees the Atman within.  In the last chapter the Ruler of Death instructed Nachiketas regarding the nature and glory of the Self.  Now he shows the reason why the Self is not seen by the majority.  It is because man's mind is constantly drawn outward through the channels of his senses, and this prevents his seeing the inner Self (Pratyagatman); but now and then a seeker, wiser than others, goes within and attains the vision of the undying Self.   \n",

Those who are devoid of discrimination and fail to distinguish between real and unreal, the fleeting and the permanent, set their hearts on the changeable things of this world; hence they entangle themselves in the net of insatiable desire, which leads inevitably to disappointment and suffering. To such, death must seem a reality because they identify themselves with that which is born and which dies.

This is why some declare God to be unknown and unknowable; because He is far more than eye or mind or speech can perceive, comprehend or express.  The Upanishad does not say that He cannot be known.  He is unknowable to man's finite nature.  How can a finite mortal apprehend the Infinite Whole?  But He can be known by man's God-like nature.   \n",

      " If thou thinkest \"I know It well,\" then it is certain that thou knowest but little of the Brahman (Absolute Truth), or in what form He (resideth) in the Devas (minor aspects of Deity). Therefore I think that what thou thinkest to be known is still to be sought after.  Having given the definition of the real Self or Brahman, by which mortals are able to see, hear, feel and think, the teacher was afraid that the disciple, after merely hearing about It, might conclude that he knew It. So he said to him: \"You have heard about It, but that is not enough. You must experience It. Mere intellectual recognition will not give you true knowledge of It. Neither can It be taught to you.  The teacher can only show the way.  You must find It for yourself.\"  Knowledge means union between subject and object.  To gain this union one must practice, theory cannot help us.  The previous chapter has shown that the knowledge of Brahman is beyond sense-perception: \"There the eye does not go, nor speech, nor mind.\"  \"That is distinct from known and also It is beyond the unknown.\"  Therefore it was necessary for the teacher to remind the disciple that knowledge based on sense-perception or intellectual apprehension should not be confounded with supersensuous knowledge.  Although the disciple had listened to the teacher with unquestioning mind and was intellectually convinced of the truth of his words, it was now necessary for him to prove by his own experience what he had heard.  Guided by the teacher, he sought within himself through meditation the meaning of Brahman; and having gained a new vision, he approached the teacher once more.   \n",
      "2.139\n",
      " The disciple said: I do not think I know It well, nor do I think that I do not know It.  He among us who knows It truly, knows (what is meant by) \"I know\" and also what is meant by \"I know It not.\"  This appears to be contradictory, but it is not.  In the previous chapter we learned that Brahman is \"distinct from the known\" and \"beyond the unknown.\" The disciple, realizing this, says: \"So far as mortal conception is concerned, I do not think I know, because I understand that It is beyond mind and speech; yet from the higher point of view, I cannot say that I do not know; for the very fact that I exist, that I can seek It, shows that I know; for It is the source of my being.  I do not know, however, in the sense of knowing the whole Infinite Ocean of existence.\"  The word knowledge is used ordinarily to signify acquaintance with phenomena only, but man must transcend this relative knowledge before he can have a clear conception of God.  One who wishes to attain Soul-consciousness must rise above matter.  The observation of material science being confined to the sense plane, it ignores what is beyond.  Therefore it must always be limited and subject to change.  It discovered atoms, then it went further and discovered electrons, and when it had found the one, it had to drop the other; so this kind of knowledge can never lead to the ultimate knowledge of the Infinite, because it is exclusive and not inclusive.  Spiritual science is not merely a question of mind and brain, it depends on the awakening of our latent higher consciousness.   \n",

The true knowers think they can never know It (because of Its infinitude), while the ignorant think they know It.  By this text the teacher confirms the idea that Brahman is unthinkable, because unconditioned.  Therefore he says: He who considers It beyond thought, beyond sense-perception, beyond mind and speech, he alone has a true understanding of Brahman.  They who judge a living being from his external form and sense faculties, know him not; because the real Self of man is not manifested in his seeing, hearing, speaking.  His real Self is that within by which he hears and speaks and sees.  In the same way he knows not Brahman who thinks he knows It by name and form.  The arrogant and foolish man thinks he knows everything; but the true knower is humble.  He says: \"How can I know Thee, who art Infinite and beyond mind and speech?\"  In the last portion of the text, the teacher draws an impressive contrast between the attitude of the wise man who knows, but thinks he does not know; and that of the ignorant who does not know, but thinks he knows.   \n",

      " It (Brahman) is known, when It is known in every state of consciousness.  (Through such knowledge) one attains immortality. By attaining this Self, man gains strength; and by Self-knowledge immortality is attained.  We have learned from the previous text that the Brahman is unknown to those whose knowledge is limited to sense experience; but He is not unknown to those whose purified intelligence perceives Him as the basis of all states of consciousness and the essence of all things.  By this higher knowledge a man attains immortality, because he knows that although his body may decay and die, the subtle essence of his being remains untouched.  Such an one also acquires unlimited strength, because he identifies himself with the ultimate Source.  The strength which comes from one's own muscle and brain or from one's individual power must be limited and mortal and therefore cannot lift one beyond death; but through the strength which Atma-gnana or Self-knowledge gives, immortality is reached.  Whenever knowledge is based on direct perception of this undying essence, one transcends all fear of death and becomes immortal.   \n",

There is a Brahma, the first person of the Hindu Trinity; but Brahman is the Absolute, the One without a second, the essence of all.  There are different names and forms which represent certain personal aspects of Divinity, such as Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver and Siva the Transformer; but no one of these can fully represent the Whole.  Brahman is the vast ocean of being, on which rise numberless ripples and waves of manifestation.  From the smallest atomic form to a Deva or an angel, all spring from that limitless ocean of Brahman, the inexhaustible Source of life.  No manifested form of life can be independent of its source, just as no wave, however mighty, can be independent of the ocean.  Nothing moves without that Power.  He is the only Doer.

Mind alone can picture the indescribable Brahman; and mind alone, being swift in its nature, can follow Him.

But dreams are something more, for the images are in a sense real, objective on their own plane; and the knowledge that there is another world, even a dream-world, lightens the tyranny of material life. Much of poetry and art is such a solace from dreamland. But there is more in dream, for it may image what is above, as well as what is below; not only the children of men, but also the children by the shore of the immortal sea that brought us hither, may throw their images on this magic mirror: so, too, of the secrets of dreamless sleep with its pure vision, in even greater degree.  \n",

      " Here is a thought which our own day is beginning to grasp: that love is a form of knowledge; that we truly know any thing or any person, by becoming one therewith, in love. Thus love has a wisdom that the mind cannot claim, and by this hearty love, this becoming one with what is beyond our personal borders, we may take a long step toward freedom. Two directions for this may be suggested: the pure love of the artist for his work, and the earnest, compassionate search into the hearts of others.  \n",

This steady pressure, this becoming one with what we seek to understand, whether it be atom or soul, is the one means to know. When we become a thing, we really know it, not otherwise. Therefore live the life, to know the doctrine; do the will of the Father, if you would know the Father.  \n",

This is a fuller expression of the last Sutra, and is so lucid that comment can hardly add to it. Everything is either perceiver, perceiving, or the thing perceived; or, as we might say, consciousness, force, or matter. The sage tells us that the one key will unlock the secrets of all three, the secrets of consciousness, force and matter alike. The thought is, that the cordial sympathy of a gentle heart, intuitively understanding the hearts of others, is really a manifestation of the same power as that penetrating perception whereby one divines the secrets of planetary motions or atomic structure.  \n",

      "name, the object dwelt on and the idea, this is perception with exterior consideration.  In the first stage of the consideration of an external object, the perceiving mind comes to it, preoccupied by the name and idea conventionally associated with that object. For example, in coming to the study of a book, we think of the author, his period, the school to which he belongs. The second stage, set forth in the next Sutra, goes directly to the spiritual meaning of the book, setting its traditional trappings aside and finding its application to our own experience and problems.  The commentator takes a very simple illustration: a cow, where one considers, in the first stage, the name of the cow, the animal itself and the idea of a cow in the mind. In the second stage, one pushes these trappings aside and, entering into the inmost being of the cow, shares its consciousness, as do some of the artists who paint cows. They get at the very life of what they study and paint.  \n",

Such perception as is here described is of the nature of that penetrating vision whereby Newton, intending his mind on things, made his discoveries, or that whereby a really great portrait painter pierces to the soul of him whom he paints, and makes that soul live on canvas. These stages of perception are described in this way, to lead the mind up to an understanding of the piercing soul-vision of the spiritual man, the immortal.  \n",

It is precisely by comparing, arranging and superposing these mind-images that we get our general notions or concepts. This process of analysis and synthesis, whereby we select certain qualities in a group of mind-images, and then range together those of like quality, is the judicial action of the mind spoken of. But when we exercise swift divination upon the mind images, as does a poet or a man of genius, then we use a power higher than the judicial, and one nearer to the keen vision of the spiritual man.  \n",

As we ascend from outer material things which are permeated by separateness, and whose chief characteristic is to be separate, just as so many pebbles are separate from each other; as we ascend, first, to mind-images, which overlap and coalesce in both space and time, and then to ideas and principles, we finally come to purer essences, drawing ever nearer and nearer to unity.  Or we may illustrate this principle thus. Our bodily, external selves are quite distinct and separate, in form, name, place, substance; our mental selves, of finer substance, meet and part, meet and part again, in perpetual concussion and interchange; our spiritual selves attain true consciousness through unity, where the partition wall between us and the Highest, between us and others, is broken down and we are all made perfect in the One. The highest riches are possessed by all pure souls, only when united. Thus we rise from separation to true individuality in unity.  \n",

The Scriptures teach general truths, concerning universal spiritual life and broad laws, and inference from their teaching is not less general.

He receives defined, precise knowledge, exactly applying to what he has at heart.  \n",

Each state or field of the mind, each field of knowledge, so to speak, which is reached by mental and emotional energies, is a psychical state, just as the mind picture of a stage with the actors on it, is a psychical state or field. When the pure vision, as of the poet, the philosopher, the saint, fills the whole field, all lesser views and visions are crowded out. This high consciousness displaces all lesser consciousness. Yet, in a certain sense, that which is viewed as part, even by the vision of a sage, has still an element of illusion, a thin psychical veil, however pure and luminous that veil may be. It is the last and highest psychic state.  \n",

      "aspiration, spiritual reading, and complete obedience to the Master.  The word which I have rendered \"fervent aspiration\" means primarily \"fire\"; and, in the Eastern teaching, it means the fire which gives life and light, and at the same time the fire which purifies. We have, therefore, as our first practice, as the first of the means of spiritual growth, that fiery quality of the will which enkindles and illumines, and, at the same time, the steady practice of purification, the burning away of all known impurities. Spiritual reading is so universally accepted and understood, that it needs no comment. The very study of Patanjali's Sutras is an exercise in spiritual reading, and a very effective one. And so with all other books of the Soul. Obedience to the Master means, that we shall make the will of the Master our will, and shall confirm in all wave to the will of the Divine, setting aside the wills of self, which are but psychic distortions of the one Divine Will. The constant effort to obey in all the ways we know and understand, will reveal new ways and new tasks, the evidence of new growth of the Soul. Nothing will do more for the spiritual man in us than this, for there is no such regenerating power as the awakening spiritual will.  \n",
      "3.51\n",
      " The aim of fervour, spiritual reading and obedience to the Master, is, to bring soulvision, and to wear away hindrances. Or, to use the phrase we have already adopted, the aim of these practices is, to help the spiritual man to open his eyes; to help him also to throw aside the veils and disguises, the enmeshing psychic nets which surround him, tying his hands, as it were, and bandaging his eyes. And this, as all teachers testify, is a long and arduous task, a steady up-hill fight, demanding fine courage and persistent toil. Fervour, the fire of the spiritual will, is, as we said, two-fold: it illumines, and so helps the spiritual man to see; and it also burns up the nets and meshes which ensnare the spiritual man. So with the other means, spiritual reading and obedience. Each, in its action, is two-fold, wearing away the psychical, and upbuilding the spiritual man.  \n",
      "3.52\n",
      "lust hate, attachment.  Let us try to translate this into terms of the psychical and spiritual man. The darkness of unwisdom is, primarily, the self-absorption of the psychical man, his complete preoccupation with his own hopes and fears, plans and purposes, sensations and desires; so that he fails to see, or refuses to see, that there is a spiritual man; and so doggedly resists all efforts of the spiritual man to cast off his psychic tyrant and set himself free. This is the real darkness; and all those who deny the immortality of the soul, or deny the soul's existence, and so lay out their lives wholly for the psychical, mortal man and his ambitions, are under this power of darkness. Born of this darkness, this psychic self-absorption, is the dogged conviction that the psychic, personal man has separate, exclusive interests, which he can follow for himself alone; and this conviction, when put into practice in our life, leads to contest with other personalities, and so to hate. This hate, again, makes against the spiritual man, since it hinders the revelation of the high harmony between the spiritual man and his other selves, a harmony to be revealed only through the practice of love, that perfect love which casts out fear.  In like manner, lust is the psychic man's craving for the stimulus of sensation, the din of which smothers the voice of the spiritual man, as, in Shakespeare's phrase, the cackling geese would drown the song of the nightingale. And this craving for stimulus is the fruit of weakness, coming from the failure to find strength in the primal life of the spiritual man.  Attachment is but another name for psychic self-absorption; for we are absorbed, not in outward things, but rather in their images within our minds; our inner eyes are fixed on them; our inner desires brood over them; and em we blind ourselves to the presence of the prisoner' the enmeshed and fettered spiritual man.  \n",
      "3.53\n",
      "hindrances may be dormant, or worn thin, or suspended, or expanded.  Here we have really two Sutras in one. The first has been explained already: in the darkness of unwisdom grow the parasites, hate, lust, attachment. They are all outgrowths of the self-absorption of the psychical self.  Next, we are told that these barriers may be either dormant, or suspended, or expanded, or worn thin. Faults which are dormant will be brought out through the pressure of life, or through the pressure of strong aspiration. Thus expanded, they must be fought and conquered, or, as Patanjali quaintly says, they must be worn thin,-as a veil might, or the links of manacles.  \n",
      "3.54\n",
      "impure, full of pain, not the Soul, to be eternal, pure, full of joy, the Soul.  This we have really considered already. The psychic man is unenduring, impure, full of pain, not the Soul, not the real Self. The spiritual man is enduring, pure, full of joy, the real Self. The darkness of unwisdom is, therefore, the self-absorption of the psychical, personal man, to the exclusion of the spiritual man. It is the belief, carried into action, that the personal man is the real man, the man for whom we should toil, for whom we should build, for whom we should live. This is that psychical man of whom it is said: he that soweth to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption.  \n",

To translate this into our terms, we may say that the Seer is the spiritual man; the instrument of vision is the psychical man, through which the spiritual man gains experience of the outer world. But we turn the servant into the master. We attribute to the psychical man, the personal self, a reality which really belongs to the spiritual man alone; and so, thinking of the quality of the spiritual man as belonging to the psychical, we merge the spiritual man in the psychical; or, as the text says, we think of the two as forming one self.  \n",
      "3.56\n",
      " This has been explained again and again. Sensation, as, for example, the sense of taste, is meant to be the guide to action; in this case, the choice of wholesome food, and the avoidance of poisonous and hurtful things. But if we rest in the sense of taste, as a pleasure in itself; rest, that is, in the psychical side of taste, we fall into gluttony, and live to eat, instead of eating to live. So with the other great organic power, the power of reproduction. This lust comes into being, through resting in the sensation, and looking for pleasure from that.  \n",

This prevails even in those who have attained much wisdom, so long as it falls short of the wisdom of complete renunciation, complete obedience to each least behest of the spiritual man, and of the Master who guards and aids the spiritual man.  The desire of sensation, the desire of psychic life, reproduces itself, carried on by its own energy and momentum; and hence comes the circle of death and rebirth, death and rebirth, instead of the liberation of the spiritual man.  \n",

      "removed by a countercurrent.  The darkness of unwisdom is to be removed by the light of wisdom, pursued through fervour, spiritual reading of holy teachings and of life itself, and by obedience to the Master.  Lust is to be removed by pure aspiration of spiritual life, which, bringing true strength and stability, takes away the void of weakness which we try to fill by the stimulus of sensations.  Hate is to be overcome by love. The fear that arises through the sense of separate, warring selves is to be stilled by the realization of the One Self, the one soul in all. This realization is the perfect love that casts out fear.  The hindrances are said to have become subtle when, by initial efforts, they have been located and recognized in the psychic nature.  \n",
      "3.60\n",
      " Here is, in truth, the whole secret of Yoga, the science of the soul. The active turnings, the strident vibrations, of selfishness, lust and hate are to be stilled by meditation, by letting heart and mind dwell in spiritual life, by lifting up the heart to the strong, silent life above, which rests in the stillness of eternal love, and needs no harsh vibration to convince it of true being.  \n",

The burden of bondage to sorrow has its root in the darkness of unwisdom, in selfishness, in lust, in hate, in attachment to sensation. All these are, in the last analysis, absorption in the psychical self; and this means sorrow, because it means the sense of separateness, and this means jarring discord and inevitable death.

But this much is clearly understood: that, through a kind of spiritual gravitation, the incarnating self is drawn to a home and life-circle which will give it scope and discipline; and its need of discipline is clearly conditioned by its character, its standing, its accomplishment.  \n",

Since holiness is obedience to divine law, to the law of divine harmony, and obedience to harmony strengthens that harmony in the soul, which is the one true joy, therefore joy comes of holiness: comes, indeed, in no other way. And as unholiness is disobedience, and therefore discord, therefore unholiness makes for pain; and this two-fold law is true, whether the cause take effect in this, or in a yet unmanifested birth.  \n",

The whole life of the psychic self is misery, because it ever waxes and wanes; because birth brings inevitable death; because there is no expectation without its shadow, fear. The life of the psychic self is misery, because it is afflicted with restlessness; so that he who has much, finds not satisfaction, but rather the whetted hunger for more. The fire is not quenched by pouring oil on it; so desire is not quenched by the satisfaction of desire. Again, the life of the psychic self is misery, because it makes ever new dynamic impresses in the mind; because a desire satisfied is but the seed from which springs the desire to find like satisfaction again. The appetite comes in eating, as the proverb says, and grows by what it feeds on. And the psychic self, torn with conflicting desires, is ever the house divided against itself, which must surely fall.  \n",

These, in their grosser form, make the material world; in their finer, more subjective form, they make the psychical world, the world of sense-impressions and mind-images.

St. Paul, following after Philo and Plato, lays down the same fundamental principle: the things seen are temporal, the things unseen are eternal.  Patanjali means something more than an intellectual assent, though this too is vital. He has in view a constant discriminating in act as well as thought; of the two ways which present themselves for every deed or choice, always to choose the higher way, that which makes for the things eternal: honesty rather than roguery, courage and not cowardice, the things of another rather than one's own, sacrifice and not indulgence.

Second, the causes of the danger to be escaped are worn away; they need not be worn away a second time. Third, the way of escape is clearly perceived, by the contemplation which checks psychic perturbation. Fourth, the means of escape, clear discernment, has been developed. This is the fourfold release belonging to insight. The final release from the psychic is three-fold: As fifth of the seven degrees, the dominance of its thinking is ended; as sixth, its potencies, like rocks from a precipice, fall of themselves; once dissolved, they do not grow again. Then, as seventh, freed from these potencies, the spiritual man stands forth in his own nature as purity and light.

Almost identical is St. Paul's list: Thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not covet. And in the same spirit is the answer made to the young map having great possessions, who asked, What shall I do to be saved? and received the reply: Keep the Commandments.  This broad, general training, which forms and develops human character, must be accomplished to a very considerable degree, before there can be much hope of success in the further stages of spiritual life.

So the first steps in spiritual life must be taken by bringing ourselves into voluntary obedience to these spiritual laws and thus making ourselves partakers of the spiritual powers, the being of the Eternal Like the law of gravity, the need of air to breathe, these great laws know no exceptions They are in force in all lands, throughout al times, for all mankind.  \n",

The Commandments may be obeyed in outer acts and abstinences; the Rules demand obedience of the heart and spirit, a far more awakened and more positive consciousness.

We may imprison such a thief, and deprive him of all possibility of further theft, or of using the divine gift of will. Or we may recognize his disadvantages, and help him gradually to build up possessions which express his will, and draw forth his self-respect. If we imagine that, after he has built well, and his possessions have become dear to him, he himself is robbed, then we can see how he would come vividly to realize the essence of theft and of honesty, and would cleave to honest dealings with firm conviction. In some such way does the great Law teach us. Our sorrows and losses teach us the pain of the sorrow and loss we inflict on others, and so we cease to inflict them.  Now as to the more direct application. To conquer a sin, let heart and mind rest, not on the sin, but on the contrary virtue. Let the sin be forced out by positive growth in the true direction, not by direct opposition. Turn away from the sin and go forward courageously, constructively, creatively, in well-doing. In this way the whole nature will gradually be drawn up to the higher level, on which the sin does not even exist. The conquest of a sin is a matter of growth and evolution, rather than of opposition.  \n",

Therefore must the weight be cast on the other side.  Here are the causes of sin: greed, wrath, infatuation, with their effects, ignorance and pain. The causes are to be cured by better wisdom, by a truer understanding of the Self, of Life. For greed cannot endure before the realization that the whole world belongs to the Self, which Self we are; nor can we hold wrath against one who is one with the Self, and therefore with ourselves; nor can infatuation, which is the seeking for the happiness of the All in some limited part of it, survive the knowledge that we are heirs of the All.

In like manner the firm and upright poise of the spiritual man is to be gained by steady and continued effort, always guided by wisdom, and by setting the heart on the Eternal, filling the soul with the atmosphere of the spiritual world.

But the deeper meaning is, that the spiritual man, when he has gained poise through right effort and aspiration, can stand firm, and guide the currents of his life, both the incoming current of events, and the outgoing current of his acts.  Exactly the same symbolism is used in the saying: Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man....

This we must do, first, by purification, through the Commandments and the Rules; and, second, through the faculty of spiritual attention, by steadily heeding endless fine intimations of the spiritual power within us, and by intending our consciousness thereto; thus by degrees transferring the centre of consciousness from the psychical to the spiritual.

The first is the focussing of the searchlight of consciousness upon the object. The other is the holding of the white beam of light steadily and persistently on the object, until it yields up the secret of its details. So for things within; one may fix the inner glance for a moment on spiritual things, or one may hold the consciousness steadily upon them, until what was in the dark slowly comes forth into the light, and yields up its immortal secret. But this is possible only for the spiritual man, after the Commandments and the Rules have been kept; for until this is done, the thronging storms of psychical thoughts dissipate and distract the attention, so that it will not remain fixed on spiritual things.

Then this attending consciousness is held on its object. Third, there is the ardent will to know its meaning, to illumine it with comprehending thought. Fourth, all personal bias--all desire merely to indorse a previous opinion and so prove oneself right, and all desire for personal profit or gratification must be quite put away. There must be a purely disinterested love of truth for its own sake. Thus is the perceiving consciousness made void, as it were, of all personality or sense of separateness.

When the personal limitation of the perceiving consciousness stands aside, and allows the All-conscious to come to bear upon the problem, then arises that real knowledge which is called a flash of genius; that real knowledge which makes discoveries, and without which no discovery can be made, however painstaking the effort. For genius is the vision of the spiritual man, and that vision is a question of growth rather than present effort; though right effort, rightly continued, will in time infallibly lead to growth and vision. Through the power thus to set aside personal limitation, to push aside petty concerns and cares, and steady the whole nature and will in an ardent love of truth and desire to know it; through the power thus to make way for the All-consciousness, all great men make their discoveries. Newton, watching the apple fall to the earth, was able to look beyond, to see the subtle waves of force pulsating through apples and worlds and suns and galaxies, and thus to perceive universal gravitation. The Oversoul, looking through his eyes, recognized the universal force, one of its own children. Darwin, watching the forms and motions of plants and animals, let the same august consciousness come to bear on them, and saw infinite growth perfected through ceaseless struggle. He perceived the superb process of evolution, the Oversoul once more recognizing its own. Fraunhofer, noting the dark lines in the band of sunlight in his spectroscope, divined their identity with the bright lines in the spectra of incandescent iron, sodium and the rest, and so saw the oneness of substance in the worlds and suns, the unity of the materials of the universe. Once again the Oversoul, looking with his eyes, recognized its own. So it is with all true knowledge.

When the spiritual man is able to throw aside the trammels of emotional and mental limitation, and to open his eyes, he sees clearly, he attains to illuminated perception. A poet once said that Occultism is the conscious cultivation of genius; and it is certain that the awakened spiritual man attains to the perceptions of genius. Genius is the vision, the power, of the spiritual man, whether its possessor recognizes this or not. All true knowledge is of the spiritual man. The greatest in all ages have recognized this and put their testimony on record. The great in wisdom who have not consciously recognized it, have ever been full of the spirit of reverence, of selfless devotion to truth, of humility, as was Darwin; and reverence and humility are the unconscious recognition of the nearness of the Spirit, that Divinity which broods over us, a Master o'er a slave.  \n",

At each point, there was attention, concentration, insight; until these were attained, no progress to the next point was possible. So with Darwin. He had to learn the form and use of leaf and flower, of bone and muscle; the characteristics of genera and species; the distribution of plants and animals, before he had in mind that nexus of knowledge on which the light of his great idea was at last able to shine. So is it with all knowledge. So is it with spiritual knowledge. Take the matter this way: The first subject for the exercise of my spiritual insight is my day, with its circumstances, its hindrances, its opportunities, its duties. I do what I can to solve it, to fulfil its duties, to learn its lessons. I try to live my day with aspiration and faith. That is the first step. By doing this, I gather a harvest for the evening, I gain a deeper insight into life, in virtue of which I begin the next day with a certain advantage, a certain spiritual advance and attainment. So with all successive days.

The reason is this: The threefold power we have been considering, the triad of Attention, Contemplation, Meditation is, so far as we have yet considered it, the focussing of the beam of perceiving consciousness upon some form of manifesting being, with a view of understanding it completely. There is a higher stage, where the beam of consciousness is turned back upon itself, and the individual consciousness enters into, and knows, the All consciousness. This is a being, a being in immortality, rather than a knowing; it is free from mental analysis or mental forms. It is not an activity of the higher mind, even the mind of the spiritual man. It is an activity of the soul. Had Newton risen to this higher stage, he would have known, not the laws of motion, but that high Being, from whose Life comes eternal motion. Had Darwin risen to this, he would have seen the Soul, whose graduated thought and being all evolution expresses. There are, therefore, these two perceptions: that of living things, and that of the Life; that of the Soul's works, and that of the Soul itself.  \n",

      "there is the overcoming of the mind-impress of excitation. Then comes the manifestation of the mind-impress of Control. Then the perceiving consciousness follows after the moment of Control.  This is the development of Control. The meaning seems to be this: Some object enters the field of observation, and at first violently excites the mind, stirring up curiosity, fear, wonder; then the consciousness returns upon itself, as it were, and takes the perception firmly in hand, steadying itself, and viewing the matter calmly from above. This steadying effort of the will upon the perceiving consciousness is Control, and immediately upon it follows perception, understanding, insight.   Take a trite example. Supposing one is walking in an Indian forest. A charging elephant suddenly appears. The man is excited by astonishment, and, perhaps, terror. But he exercises an effort of will, perceives the situation in its true bearings, and recognizes that a certain thing must be done; in this case, probably, that he must get out of the way as quickly as possible.  Or a comet, unheralded, appears in the sky like a flaming sword. The beholder is at first astonished, perhaps terror-stricken; but he takes himself in hand, controls his thoughts, views the apparition calmly, and finally calculates its orbit and its relation to meteor showers.  These are extreme illustrations; but with all knowledge the order of perception is the same: first, the excitation of the mind by the new object impressed on it; then the control of the mind from within; upon which follows the perception of the nature of the object. Where the eyes of the spiritual man are open, this will be a true and penetrating spiritual perception. In some such way do our living experiences come to us; first, with a shock of pain; then the Soul steadies itself and controls the pain; then the spirit perceives the lesson of the event, and its bearing upon the progressive revelation of life.  \n",

Control of the mind by the Soul, like control of the muscles by the mind, comes by practice, and constant voluntary repetition.  As an example of control of the muscles by the mind, take the ceaseless practice by which a musician gains mastery over his instrument, or a fencer gains skill with a rapier. Innumerable small efforts of attention will make a result which seems well-nigh miraculous; which, for the novice, is really miraculous. Then consider that far more wonderful instrument, the perceiving mind, played on by that fine musician, the Soul. Here again, innumerable small efforts of attention will accumulate into mastery, and a mastery worth winning. For a concrete example, take the gradual conquest of each day, the effort to live that day for the Soul. To him that is faithful unto death, the Master gives the crown of life.  \n",

As an illustration of the mind's tendency to flit from one object to another, take a small boy, learning arithmetic. He begins: two ones are two; three ones are three-and then he thinks of three coins in his pocket, which will purchase so much candy, in the store down the street, next to the toy-shop, where are base-balls, marbles and so on,--and then he comes back with a jerk, to four ones are four. So with us also. We are seeking the meaning of our task, but the mind takes advantage of a moment of slackened attention, and flits off from one frivolous detail to another, till we suddenly come back to consciousness after traversing leagues of space. We must learn to conquer this, and to go back within ourselves into the beam of perceiving consciousness itself, which is a beam of the Oversoul. This is the true onepointedness, the bringing of our consciousness to a focus in the Soul.   12. When, following this, the controlled manifold tendency and the aroused one-pointedness are equally balanced parts of the perceiving consciousness, his the development of one-pointedness.  This would seem to mean that the insight which is called one-pointedness has two sides, equally balanced. There is, first, the manifold aspect of any object, the sum of all its characteristics and properties. This is to be held firmly in the mind. Then there is the perception of the object as a unity, as a whole, the perception of its essence. First, the details must be clearly perceived; then the essence must be comprehended. When the two processes are equally balanced, the true onepointedness is attained. Everything has these two sides, the side of difference and the side of unity; there is the individual and there is the genus; the pole of matter and diversity, and the pole of oneness and spirit.

Thus we see a rose as that particular flower, with its colour and scent, its peculiar fold of each petal; but we also see in it the species, the family to which it belongs, with its relation to all plants, to all life, to Life itself.

In like manner, the chrysalis has, as its past, the caterpillar; as its future, the butterfly. The man has, in his past, the animal; in his future, the angel. Both are visible even now in his face.

He who, having entry to the consciousness of the Eternal knows the essence of this power, can divine the meanings of all sounds, from the voice of the insect to the music of the spheres.  In like manner, he who has attained to spiritual vision can perceive the mind-images in the thoughts of others, with the shade of feeling which goes with them, thus reading their thoughts as easily as he hears their words. Every one has the germ of this power, since difference of tone will give widely differing meanings to the same words, meanings which are intuitively perceived by everyone.  \n",

The fine harvest of past experiences is drawn into the spiritual nature, forming, indeed, the basis of its development.

Shankara tells us that by this power the popular magicians of the East perform their wonders, working on the mind-images of others, while remaining invisible themselves. It is all a question of being able to see and control the mind-images.  \n",

So in this Sutra the fixed polestar is the eternal spirit about which all things move, as well as the star toward which points the axis of the earth.

      "lower trunk brings an understanding of the order of the bodily powers. We are coming to a vitally important part of the teaching of Yoga: namely, the spiritual man's attainment of full self-consciousness, the awakening of the spiritual man as a self-conscious individual, behind and above the natural man. In this awakening, and in the process of gestation which precedes it, there is a close relation with the powers of the natural man, which are, in a certain sense, the projection, outward and downward, of the powers of the spiritual man. This is notably true of that creative power of the spiritual man which, when embodied in the natural man, becomes the power of generation. Not only is this power the cause of the continuance of the bodily race of mankind, but further, in the individual, it is the key to the dominance of the personal life. Rising, as it were, through the life-channels of the body, it flushes the personality with physical force, and maintains and colours the illusion that the physical life is the dominant and all-important expression of life. In due time, when the spiritual man has begun to take form, the creative force will be drawn off, and become operative in building the body of the spiritual man, just as it has been operative in the building of physical bodies, through generation in the natural world.  Perfectly concentrated Meditation on the nature of this force means, first, that rising of the consciousness into the spiritual world, already described, which gives the one sure foothold for Meditation; and then, from that spiritual point of vantage, not only an insight into the creative force, in its spiritual and physical aspects, but also a gradually attained control of this wonderful force, which will mean its direction to the body of the spiritual man, and its gradual withdrawal from the body of the natural man, until the over-pressure, so general and such a fruitful source of misery in our day, is abated, and purity takes the place of passion. This over pressure, which is the cause of so many evils and so much of human shame, is an abnormal, not a natural, condition. It is primarily due to spiritual blindness, to blindness regarding the spiritual man, and ignorance even of his existence; for by this blind ignorance are closed the channels through which, were they open, the creative force could flow into the body of the spiritual man, there building up an immortal vesture. There is no cure for blindness, with its consequent over-pressure and attendant misery and shame, but spiritual vision, spiritual aspiration, sacrifice, the new birth from above. There is no other way to lighten the burden, to lift the misery and shame from human life. Therefore, let us follow after sacrifice and aspiration, let us seek the light. In this way only shall we gain that insight into the order of the bodily powers, and that mastery of them, which this Sutra implies.  \n",

      "well of the throat, there comes the cessation of hunger and thirst.  We are continuing the study of the bodily powers and centres of force in their relation to the powers and forces of the spiritual man. We have already considered the dominant power of physical life, the creative power which secures the continuance of physical life; and, further, the manner in which, through aspiration and sacrifice, it is gradually raised and set to the work of upbuilding the body of the spiritual man. We come now to the dominant psychic force, the power which manifests itself in speech, and in virtue of which the voice may carry so much of the personal magnetism, endowing the orator with a tongue of fire, magical in its power to arouse and rule the emotions of his hearers. This emotional power, this distinctively psychical force, is the cause of \"hunger and thirst,\" the psychical hunger and thirst for sensations, which is the source of our two-sided life of emotionalism, with its hopes and fears, its expectations and memories, its desires and hates. The source of this psychical power, or, perhaps we should say, its centre of activity in the physical body is said to be in the cavity of the throat. Thus, in the Taittiriya Upanishad it is written: \"There is this shining ether in the inner being. Therein is the spiritual man, formed through thought, immortal, golden. Inward, in the palate, the organ that hangs down like a nipple,-this is the womb of Indra. And there, where the dividing of the hair turns, extending upward to the crown of the head.\"  Indra is the name given to the creative power of which we have spoken, and which, we are told, resides in \"the organ which hangs down like a nipple, inward, in the palate.\"  \n",

      "channel called the \"tortoise-formed,\" comes steadfastness.  We are concerned now with the centre of nervous or psychical force below the cavity of the throat, in the chest, in which is felt the sensation of fear; the centre, the disturbance of which sets the heart beating miserably with dread, or which produces that sense of terror through which the heart is said to stand still.  When the truth concerning fear is thoroughly mastered, through spiritual insight into the immortal, fearless life, then this force is perfectly controlled; there is no more fear, just as, through the control of the psychic power which works through the nerve-centre in the throat, there comes a cessation of \"hunger and thirst.\" Thereafter, these forces, or their spiritual prototypes, are turned to the building of the spiritual man.  Always, it must be remembered, the victory is first a spiritual one; only later does it bring control of the bodily powers.  \n",

      "comes the vision of the Masters who have attained.  The tradition is, that there is a certain centre of force in the head, perhaps the \"pineal gland,\" which some of our Western philosophers have supposed to be the dwelling of the soul, a centre which is, as it were, the door way between the natural and the spiritual man. It is the seat of that better and wiser consciousness behind the outward looking consciousness in the forward part of the head; that better and wiser consciousness of \"the back of the mind,\" which views spiritual things, and seeks to impress the spiritual view on the outward looking consciousness in the forward part of the head. It is the spiritual man seeking to guide the natural man, seeking to bring the natural man to concern himself with the things of his immortality. This is suggested in the words of the Upanishad already quoted: \"There, where the dividing of the hair turns, extending upward to the crown of the head\"; all of which may sound very fantastical, until one comes to understand it.  It is said that when this power is fully awakened, it brings a vision of the great Companions of the spiritual man, those who have already attained, crossing over to the further shore of the sea of death and rebirth. Perhaps it is to this divine sight that the Master alluded, who is reported to have said: \"I counsel you to buy of me eye-salve, that you may see.\" It is of this same vision of the great Companions, the children of light, that a seer wrote:       \"Though inland far we be,      Our souls have sight of that immortal sea      Which brought us hither,      Can in a moment travel thither,      And see the Children sport upon the shore      And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.\"  \n",
      "3.135\n",
      " This is really the supplement, the spiritual side, of the Sutra just translated. Step by step, as the better consciousness, the spiritual view, gains force in the back of the mind, so, in the same measure, the spiritual man is gaining the power to see: learning to open the spiritual eyes. When the eyes are fully opened, the spiritual man beholds the great Companions standing about him; he has begun to \"know all things.\"  This divining power of intuition is the power which lies above and behind the so-called rational mind; the rational mind formulates a question and lays it before the intuition, which gives a real answer, often immediately distorted by the rational mind, yet always embodying a kernel of truth. It is by this process, through which the rational mind brings questions to the intuition for solution, that the truths of science are reached, the flashes of discovery and genius. But this higher power need not work in subordination to the so-called rational mind, it may act directly, as full illumination, \"the vision and the faculty divine.\"  \n",

The heart here seems to mean, as it so often does in the Upanishads, the interior, spiritual nature, the consciousness of the spiritual man, which is related to the heart, and to the wisdom of the heart. By steadily seeking after, and finding, the consciousness of the spiritual man, by coming to consciousness as the spiritual man, a perfect knowledge of consciousness will be attained. For the consciousness of the spiritual man has this divine quality: while being and remaining a truly individual consciousness, it at the same time flows over, as it were, and blends with the Divine Consciousness above and about it, the consciousness of the great Companions; and by showing itself to be one with the Divine Consciousness, it reveals the nature of all consciousness, the secret that all consciousness is One and Divine.  \n",

      "perceive the distinction between the personal self and the spiritual man. All personal experience really exists for the sake of another: namely, the spiritual man. By perfectly concentrated Meditation on experience for the sake of the Self, comes a knowledge of the spiritual man.  The divine ray of the Higher Self, which is eternal, impersonal and abstract, descends into life, and forms a personality, which, through the stress and storm of life, is hammered into a definite and concrete self-conscious individuality. The problem is, to blend these two powers, taking the eternal and spiritual being of the first, and blending with it, transferring into it, the self-conscious individuality of the second; and thus bringing to life a third being, the spiritual man, who is heir to the immortality of his father, the Higher Self, and yet has the self-conscious, concrete individuality of his other parent, the personal self. This is the true immaculate conception, the new birth from above, \"conceived of the Holy Spirit.\" Of this new birth it is said: \"that which is born of the Spirit is spirit: ye must be born again.\"  Rightly understood, therefore, the whole life of the personal man is for another, not for himself. He exists only to render his very life and all his experience for the building up of the spiritual man. Only through failure to see this, does he seek enjoyment for himself, seek to secure the feasts of life for himself; not understanding that he must live for the other, live sacrificially, offering both feasts and his very being on the altar; giving himself as a contribution for the building of the spiritual man. When he does understand this, and lives for the Higher Self, setting his heart and thought on the Higher Self, then his sacrifice bears divine fruit, the spiritual man is built up, consciousness awakes in him, and he comes fully into being as a divine and immortal individuality.  \n",

When, in virtue of the perpetual sacrifice of the personal man, daily and hourly giving his life for his divine brother the spiritual man, and through the radiance ever pouring down from the Higher Self, eternal in the Heavens, the spiritual man comes to birth,-there awake in him those powers whose physical counterparts we know in the personal man. The spiritual man begins to see, to hear, to touch, to taste. And, besides the senses of the spiritual man, there awakes his mind, that divine counterpart of the mind of the physical man, the power of direct and immediate knowledge, the power of spiritual intuition, of divination. This power, as we have seen, owes its virtue to the unity, the continuity, of consciousness, whereby whatever is known to any consciousness, is knowable by any other consciousness. Thus the consciousness of the spiritual man, who lives above our narrow barriers of separateness, is in intimate touch with the consciousness of the great Companions, and can draw on that vast reservoir for all real needs. Thus arises within the spiritual man that certain knowledge which is called intuition, divination, illumination.  \n",

Then the disciple becomes a Master. The opened powers of tile spiritual man, spiritual vision, hearing, and touch, stand, therefore, in contradistinction to the higher divine power above them, and must in no wise be regarded as the end of the way, for the path has no end, but rises ever to higher and higher glories; the soul's growth and splendour have no limit. So that, if the spiritual powers we have been considering are regarded as in any sense final, they are a hindrance, a barrier to the far higher powers of the divine man. But viewed from below, from the standpoint of normal physical experience, they are powers truly magical; as the powers natural to a four-dimensional being will appear magical to a three-dimensional being.  \n",

      "the method of sassing, the consciousness is transferred to the other body.  In due time, after the spiritual man has been formed and grown stable through the forces and virtues already enumerated, and after the senses of the spiritual man have awaked, there comes the transfer of the dominant consciousness, the sense of individuality, from the physical to the spiritual man. Thereafter the physical man is felt to be a secondary, a subordinate, an instrument through whom the spiritual man works; and the spiritual man is felt to be the real individuality. This is, in a sense, the attainment to full salvation and immortal life; yet it is not the final goal or resting place, but only the beginning of the greater way.  The means for this transfer are described as the weakening of the causes of bondage, and an understanding of the method of passing from the one consciousness to the other. The first may also be described as detach meet, and comes from the conquest of the delusion that the personal self is the real man. When that delusion abates and is held in check, the finer consciousness of the spiritual man begins to shine in the background of the mind. The transfer of the sense of individuality to this finer consciousness, and thus to the spiritual man, then becomes a matter of recollection, of attention; primarily, a matter of taking a deeper interest in the life and doings of the spiritual man, than in the pleasures or occupations of the personality. Therefore it is said: \"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust cloth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust cloth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\"  \n",

      "dangers of water, morass, and thorny places, and the power of ascension is gained.  Here is one of the sentences, so characteristic of this author, and, indeed, of the Eastern spirit, in which there is an obvious exterior meaning, and, within this, a clear interior meaning, not quite so obvious, but far more vital.  The surface meaning is, that by mastery of a certain power, called here the upward-life, and akin to levitation, there comes the ability to walk on water, or to pass over thorny places without wounding the feet.  But there is a deeper meaning. When we speak of the disciple's path as a path of thorns, we use a symbol; and the same symbol is used here. The upward-life means something more than the power, often manifested in abnormal psychical experiences, of levitating the physical body, or near-by physical objects. It means the strong power of aspiration, of upward will, which first builds, and then awakes the spiritual man, and finally transfers the conscious individuality to him; for it is he who passes safely over the waters of death and rebirth, and is not pierced by the thorns in the path. Therefore it is said that he who would tread the path of power must look for a home in the air, and afterwards in the ether.  Of the upward-life, this is written in the Katha Upanishad: \"A hundred and one are the heart's channels; of these one passes to the crown. Going up this, he comes to the immortal.\" This is the power of ascension spoken of in the Sutra.  \n",

      " In the Upanishads, it is said that this binding-life unites the upward-life to the downward-life, and these lives have their analogies in the \"vital breaths\" in the body. The thought in the text seems to be, that, when the personality is brought thoroughly under control of the spiritual man, through the life-currents which bind them together, the personality is endowed with a new force, a strong personal magnetism, one might call it, such as is often an appanage of genius.  But the text seems to mean more than this and to have in view the \"vesture of the colour of the sun\" attributed by the Upanishads to the spiritual man; that vesture which a disciple has thus described: \"The Lord shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body\"; perhaps \"body of radiance\" would better translate the Greek.  In both these passages, the teaching seems to be, that the body of the full-grown spiritual man is radiant or luminous,-for those at least, who have anointed their eyes wit! eye-salve, so that they see.  \n",

But then is a finer hearing, whose medium of transmission would seem to be the ether; perhaps no that ether which carries light, heat and magnetic waves, but, it may be, the far finer ether through which the power of gravity works. For, while light or heat or magnetic waves, travelling from the sun to the earth, take eight minutes for the journey, it is mathematically certain that the pull of gravitation does not take as much as eight seconds, or even the eighth of a second. The pull of gravitation travels, it would seem \"as quick as thought\"; so it may well be that, in thought transference or telepathy, the thoughts travel by the same way, carried by the same \"thought-swift\" medium.  The transfer of a word by telepathy is the simplest and earliest form of the \"divine hearing\" of the spiritual man; as that power grows, and as, through perfectly concentrated Meditation, the spiritual man comes into more complete mastery of it, he grows able to hear and clearly distinguish the speech of the great Companions, who counsel and comfort him on his way.

And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) how that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable [or, unspoken] words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.\"  The condition is, briefly, that of the awakened spiritual man, who sees and hears beyond the veil.  \n",

These are the endowments of the spiritual man. Further, the spiritual body is unassailable. Fire burns it not, water wets it not, the sword cleaves it not, dry winds parch it not.

When the spiritual man is perfectly disentangled from the psychic body, he attains to mastery over all things and to a knowledge of all.  The spiritual man is enmeshed in the web of the emotions; desire, fear, ambition, passion; and impeded by the mental forms of separateness and materialism. When these meshes are sundered, these obstacles completely overcome, then the spiritual man stands forth in his own wide world, strong, mighty, wise. He uses divine powers, with a divine scope and energy, working together with divine Companions. To such a one it is said: \"Thou art now a disciple, able to stand, able to hear, able to see, able to speak, thou hast conquered desire and attained to self-knowledge, thou hast seen thy soul in its bloom and recognized it, and heard the voice of the silence.\"  \n",

To the second, especially, the caution in the text is addressed. More modern teachers would express the same truth by a warning against the delusions and fascinations of the psychic realm, which open around the disciple, as he breaks through into the unseen worlds.

That wisdom, that intuitive, divining power is starlike, says the commentator, because it shines with its own light, because it rises on high, and illumines all things. Nought is hid from it, whether things past, things present, or things to come; for it is beyond the threefold form of time, so that all things are spread before it together, in the single light of the divine. This power has been beautifully described by Columba: \"Some there are, though very few, to whom Divine grace has granted this: that they can clearly and most distinctly see, at one and the same moment, as though under one ray of the sun, even the entire circuit of the whole world with its surroundings of ocean and sky, the inmost part of their mind being marvellously enlarged.\"  \n",

They are the normal powers of the spiritual man, the antetype, the divine edition, of the powers of the natural man. Through these powers, the spiritual man stands, sees, hears, speaks, in the spiritual world, as the physical man stands, sees, hears, speaks in the natural world.  There is a counterfeit presentment of the spiritual man, in the world of dreams, a shadow lord of shadows, who has his own dreamy powers of vision, of hearing, of movement; he has left the natural without reaching the spiritual. He has set forth from the shore, but has not gained the further verge of the river. He is borne along by the stream, with no foothold on either shore. Leaving the actual, he has fallen short of the real, caught in the limbo of vanities and delusions. The cause of this aberrant phantasm is always the worship of a false, vain self, the lord of dreams, within one's own breast. This is the psychic man, lord of delusive and bewildering psychic powers.  Spiritual powers, like intellectual or artistic gifts, may be inborn: the fruit, that is, of seeds planted and reared with toil in a former birth. So also the powers of the psychic man may be inborn, a delusive harvest from seeds of delusion.  Psychical powers may be gained by drugs, as poverty, shame, debasement may be gained by the self-same drugs. In their action, they are baneful, cutting the man off from consciousness of the restraining power of his divine nature, so that his forces break forth exuberant, like the laughter of drunkards, and he sees and hears things delusive. While sinking, he believes that he has risen; growing weaker, he thinks himself full of strength; beholding illusions, he takes them to be true. Such are the powers gained by drugs; they are wholly psychic, since the real powers, the spiritual, can never be so gained.  Incantations are affirmations of half-truths concerning spirit and matter, what is and what is not, which work upon the mind and slowly build up a wraith of powers and a delusive well-being. These, too, are of the psychic realm of dreams.  Lastly, there are the true powers of the spiritual man, built up and realized in Meditation, through reverent obedience to spiritual law, to the pure conditions of being, in the divine realm.  \n",

Here, if we can perceive it, is the whole secret of spiritual birth, growth and life Spiritual being, like all being, is but an expression of the Self, of the inherent power and being of Atma. Inherent in the Self are consciousness and will, which have, as their lordly heritage, the wide sweep of the universe throughout eternity, for the Self is one with the Eternal. And the consciousness of the Self may make itself manifest as seeing, hearing, tasting, feeling, or whatsoever perceptive powers there may be, just as the white sunlight may divide into many-coloured rays. So may the will of the Self manifest itself in the uttering of words, or in handling, or in moving, and whatever powers of action there are throughout the seven worlds. Where the Self is, there will its powers be. It is but a question of the vesture through which these powers shall shine forth. And wherever the consciousness and desire of the ever-creative Self are fixed, there will a vesture be built up; where the heart is, there will the treasure be also.  Since through ages the desire of the Self has been toward the natural world, wherein the Self sought to mirror himself that he might know himself, therefore a vesture of natural elements came into being, through which blossomed forth the Self's powers of perceiving and of will: the power to see, to hear, to speak, to walk, to handle; and when the Self, thus come to self-consciousness, and, with it, to a knowledge of his imprisonment, shall set his desire on the divine and real world, and raise his consciousness thereto, the spiritual vesture shall be built up for him there, with its expression of his inherent powers. Nor will migration thither be difficult for the Self, since the divine is no strange or foreign land for him, but the house of his home, where he dwells from everlasting.  \n",

The husbandman tills his field, breaking up the clods of earth into fine mould, penetrable to air and rain; he sows his seed, carefully covering it, for fear of birds and the wind; he waters the seed-laden earth, turning the little rills from the irrigation tank now this way and that, removing obstacles from the channels, until the even How of water vitalizes the whole field. And so the plants germinate and grow, first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear. But it is not the husbandman who makes them grow. It is, first, the miraculous plasmic power in the grain of seed, which brings forth after its kind; then the alchemy of sunlight which, in presence of the green colouring matter of the leaves, gathers hydrogen from the water and carbon from the gases in the air, and mingles them in the hydro-carbons of plant growth; and, finally, the wholly occult vital powers of the plant itself, stored up through ages, and flowing down from the primal sources of life. The husbandman but removes the obstacles. He plants and waters, but God gives the increase.  So with the finer husbandman of diviner fields. He tills and sows, but the growth of the spiritual man comes through the surge and flow of divine, creative forces and powers. Here, again, God gives the increase.

The Self, says a great Teacher, in turn attaches itself to three vestures: first, to the physical body, then to the finer body, and thirdly to the causal body. Finally it stands forth radiant, luminous, joyous, as the Self.  When the Self attributes itself to the physical body, there arise the states of bodily consciousness, built up about the physical self.  When the Self, breaking through this first illusion, begins to see and feel itself in the finer body, to find selfhood there, then the states of consciousness of the finer body come into being; or, to speak exactly, the finer body and its states of consciousness arise and grow together.  But the Self must not dwell permanently there. It must learn to find itself in the causal body, to build up the wide and luminous fields of consciousness that belong to that.  Nor must it dwell forever there, for there remains the fourth state, the divine, with its own splendour and everlastingness.  It is all a question of the states of consciousness; all a question of raising the sense of selfhood, until it dwells forever in the Eternal.  \n",

Consciousness is ultimately One, everywhere and forever. The Eternal, the Father, is the One Self of All Beings. And so, in each individual who is but a facet of that Self, Consciousness is One. Whether it breaks through as the dull fire of physical life, or the murky flame of the psychic and passional, or the radiance of the spiritual man, or the full glory of the Divine, it is ever the Light, naught but the Light.

Where the consciousness breaks forth in the physical body, and the full play of bodily life begins, its progression carries with it inevitable limitations. Birth involves death. Meetings have their partings. Hunger alternates with satiety. Age follows on the heels of youth. So do the states of consciousness run along the circle of birth and death.  With the psychic, the alternation between prize and penalty is swifter. Hope has its shadow of fear, or it is no hope. Exclusive love is tortured by jealousy. Pleasure passes through deadness into pain. Pain's surcease brings pleasure back again. So here, too, the states of consciousness run their circle. In all psychic states there is egotism, which, indeed, is the very essence of the psychic; and where there is egotism there is ever the seed of future sorrow. Desire carries bondage in its womb.  But where the pure spiritual consciousness begins, free from self and stain, the ancient law of retaliation ceases; the penalty of sorrow lapses and is no more imposed. The soul now passes, no longer from sorrow to sorrow, but from glory to glory. Its growth and splendour have no limit. The good passes to better, best.  \n",

Works done with self-seeking bear within them the seeds of future sorrow; conversely, according to the proverb, present pain is future gain.  But, for him who has gone beyond desire, whose desire is set on the Eternal, neither pain to be avoided nor pleasure to be gained inspires his work. He fears no hell and desires no heaven. His one desire is, to know the will of the Father and finish His work. He comes directly in line with the divine Will, and works cleanly and immediately, without longing or fear.

      "dynamic mind images which are conformable to the ripening out of each of these works.  We are now to consider the general mechanism of Karma, in order that we may pass on to the consideration of him who is free from Karma. Karma, indeed, is the concern of the personal man, of his bondage or freedom. It is the succession of the forces which built up the personal man, reproducing themselves in one personality after another.  Now let us take an imaginary case, to see how these forces may work out. Let us think of a man, with murderous intent in his heart, striking with a dagger at his enemy. He makes a red wound in his victim's breast; at the same instant he paints, in his own mind, a picture of that wound: a picture dynamic with all the fierce will-power he has put into his murderous blow. In other words he has made a deep wound in his own psychic body; and, when he comes to be born again, that body will become his outermost vesture, upon which, with its wound still there, bodily tissue will be built up. So the man will be born maimed, or with the predisposition to some mortal injury; he is unguarded at that point, and any trifling accidental blow will pierce the broken Joints of his psychic armour. Thus do the dynamic mind-images manifest themselves, coming to the surface, so that works done in the past may ripen and come to fruition.  \n",

      "together by the correspondence between memory and dynamic impression.  Just as, in the ripening out of mind-images into bodily conditions, the effect is brought about by the ray of creative force sent down by the Self, somewhat as the light of the magic lantern projects the details of a picture on the screen, revealing the hidden, and making secret things palpable and visible, so does this divine ray exercise a selective power on the dynamic mind-images, bringing together into one day of life the seeds gathered from many days. The memory constantly exemplifies this power; a passage of poetry will call up in the mind like passages of many poets, read at different times. So a prayer may call up many prayers.  In like manner, the same over-ruling selective power, which is a ray of the Higher Self, gathers together from different births and times and places those mind-images which are conformable, and may be grouped in the frame of a single life or a single event. Through this grouping, visible bodily conditions or outward circumstances are brought about, and by these the soul is taught and trained.  Just as the dynamic mind-images of desire ripen out in bodily conditions and circumstances, so the far more dynamic powers of aspiration, wherein the soul reaches toward the Eternal, have their fruition in a finer world, building the vesture of the spiritual man.  \n",
      "3.165\n",
      "Desire is everlasting.  The whole series of dynamic mind-images, which make up the entire history of the personal man, is a part of the mechanism which the Self employs, to mirror itself in a reflection, to embody its powers in an outward form, to the end of self-expression, selfrealization, self-knowledge. Therefore the initial impulse behind these dynamic mind-images comes from the Self and is the descending ray of the Self; so that it cannot be said that there is any first member of the series of images, from which the rest arose. The impulse is beginningless, since it comes from the Self, which is from everlasting. Desire is not to cease; it is to turn to the Eternal, and so become aspiration.  \n",

We are still concerned with the personal life in its bodily vesture, and with the process whereby the forces which have upheld it are gradually transferred to the life of the spiritual man, and build up for him his finer vesture in a finer world.  How is the current to be changed? How is the flow of self-reproductive mind-images, which have built the conditions of life after life in this world of bondage, to be checked, that the time of imprisonment may come to an end, the day of liberation dawn?  The answer is given in the Sutra just translated. The driving-force is withdrawn and directed to the upbuilding of the spiritual body.  When the building impulses and forces are withdrawn, the tendency to manifest a new psychical body, a new body of bondage, ceases with them.  \n",

      "come, according to their natures, depends on the difference of phase of their properties.  Here we come to a high and difficult matter, which has always been held to be of great moment in the Eastern wisdom: the thought that the division of time into past, present and future is, in great measure, an illusion; that past, present, future all dwell together in the eternal Now.  The discernment of this truth has been held to be so necessarily a part of wisdom, that one of the names of the Enlightened is: \"he who has passed beyond the three times: past, present, future.\"  So the Western Master said: \"Before Abraham was, I am\"; and again, \"I am with you always, unto the end of the world\"; using the eternal present for past and future alike. With the same purpose, the Master speaks of himself as \"the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.\"  And a Master of our own days writes: \"I feel even irritated at having to use these three clumsy words--past, present, and future. Miserable concepts of the objective phases of the subjective whole, they are about as ill adapted for the purpose, as an axe for fine carving.\"  In the eternal Now, both past and future are consummated.  Bjorklund, the Swedish philosopher, has well stated the same truth:  \"Neither past nor future can exist to God; He lives undividedly, without limitations, and needs not, as man, to plot out his existence in a series of moments. Eternity then is not identical with unending time; it is a different form of existence, related to time as the perfect to the imperfect ... Man as an entity for himself must have the natural limitations for the part. Conceived by God, man is eternal in the divine sense, but conceived, by himself, man's eternal life is clothed in the limitations we call time. The eternal is a constant present without beginning or end, without past or future.\"  \n",

      "the Three Potencies.  The Three Potencies are the three manifested modifications of the one primal material, which stands opposite to perceiving consciousness. These Three Potencies are called Substance, Force, Darkness; or viewed rather for their moral colouring, Goodness, Passion, Inertness. Every material manifestation is a projection of substance into the empty space of darkness. Every mental state is either good, or passional, or inert. So, whether subjective or objective, latent or manifest, all things that present themselves to the perceiving consciousness are compounded of these three. This is a fundamental doctrine of the Sankhya system.  \n",

      "transformations ore in the same phase.  We should be inclined to express the same law by saying, for example, that a sound is audible, when it consists of vibrations within the compass of the auditory nerve; that an object is visible, when either directly or by reflection, it sends forth luminiferous vibrations within the compass of the retina and the optic nerve. Vibrations below or above that compass make no impression at all, and the object remains invisible; as, for example, a kettle of boiling water in a dark room, though the kettle is sending forth heat vibrations closely akin to light.  So, when the vibrations of the object and those of the perceptive power are in the same phase, the external manifestation of the object takes place.  There seems to be a further suggestion that the appearance of an object in the \"present,\" or its remaining hid in the \"past,\" or \"future,\" is likewise a question of phase, and, just as the range of vibrations perceived might be increased by the development of finer senses, so the perception of things past, and things to come, may be easy from a higher point of view.  \n",

Having shown that our bodily condition and circumstances depend on Karma, while Karma depends on perception and will, the sage recognizes the fact that from this may be drawn the false deduction that material things are in no wise different from states of mind. The same thought has occurred, and still occurs, to all philosophers; and, by various reasonings, they all come to the same wise conclusion; that the material world is not made by the mood of any human mind, but is rather the manifestation of the totality of invisible Being, whether we call this Mahat, with the ancients, or Ether, with the moderns.  \n",

This is but a further development of the thought of the preceding Sutra, carrying on the thought that, while the universe is spiritual, yet its material expression is ordered, consistent, ruled by law, not subject to the whims or affirmations of a single mind. Unwelcome material things may be escaped by spiritual growth, by rising to a realm above them, and not by denying their existence on their own plane. So that our system is neither materialistic, nor idealistic in the extreme sense, but rather intuitional and spiritual, holding that matter is the manifestation of spirit as a whole, a reflection or externalization of spirit, and, like spirit, everywhere obedient to law. The path of liberation is not through denial of matter but through denial of the wills of self, through obedience, and that aspiration which builds the vesture of the spiritual man.  \n",

      "or is not, tinged with the colour of the object.  The simplest manifestation of this is the matter of attention. Our minds apprehend what they wish to apprehend; all else passes unnoticed, or, on the other hand, we perceive what we resent, as, for example, the noise of a passing train; while others, used to the sound, do not notice it at all.  But the deeper meaning is, that out of the vast totality of objects ever present in the universe, the mind perceives only those which conform to the hue of its Karma. The rest remain unseen, even though close at hand.  This spiritual law has been well expressed by Emerson:  \"Through solidest eternal things the man finds his road as if they did not subsist, and does not once suspect their being. As soon as he needs a new object, suddenly he beholds it, and no longer attempts to pass through it, but takes another way. When he has exhausted for the time the nourishment to be drawn from any one person or thing, that object is withdrawn from his observation, and though still in his immediate neighbourhood, he does not suspect its presence. Nothing is dead. Men feign themselves dead, and endure mock funerals and mournful obituaries, and there they stand looking out of the window, sound and well, in some new and strange disguise. Jesus is not dead, he is very well alive: nor John, nor Paul, nor Mahomet, nor Aristotle; at times we believe we have seen them all, and could easily tell the names under which they go.\"  \n",

      "perception, since the Spiritual Man, who is the lord of them, remains unchanging.  Here is teaching of the utmost import, both for understanding and for practice.  To the psychic nature belong all the ebb and flow of emotion, all hoping and fearing, desire and hate: the things that make the multitude of men and women deem themselves happy or miserable. To it also belong the measuring and comparing, the doubt and questioning, which, for the same multitude, make up mental life. So that there results the emotion-soaked personality, with its dark and narrow view of life: the shivering, terror driven personality that is life itself for all but all of mankind.  Yet the personality is not the true man, not the living soul at all, but only a spectacle which the true man observes. Let us under stand this, therefore, and draw ourselves up inwardly to the height of the Spiritual Man, who, standing in the quiet light of the Eternal, looks down serene upon this turmoil of the outer life.  One first masters the personality, the \"mind,\" by thus looking down on it from above, from within; by steadily watching its ebb and flow, as objective, outward, and therefore not the real Self. This standing back is the first step, detachment. The second, to maintain the vantage-ground thus gained, is recollection.  \n",

This psychic self, the personality, claims to be absolute, asserting that life is for it and through it; it seeks to impose on the whole being of man its narrow, materialistic, faithless view of life and the universe; it would clip the wings of the soaring Soul. But the Soul dethrones the tyrant, by perceiving and steadily affirming that the psychic self is no true self at all, not self-luminous, but only an object of observation, watched by the serene eyes of the Spiritual Man.  \n",

      "external to it.  The truth is that the \"mind\" knows neither external things nor itself. Its measuring and analyzing, its hoping and fearing, hating and desiring, never give it a true measure of life, nor any sense of real values. Ceaselessly active, it never really attains to knowledge; or, if we admit its knowledge, it ever falls short of wisdom, which comes only through intuition, the vision of the Spiritual Man.  Life cannot be known by the \"mind,\" its secrets cannot be learned through the \"mind.\" The proof is, the ceaseless strife and contradiction of opinion among those who trust in the mind. Much less can the \"mind\" know itself, the more so, because it is pervaded by the illusion that it truly knows, truly is.  True knowledge of the \"mind\" comes, first, when the Spiritual Man, arising, stands detached, regarding the \"mind\" from above, with quiet eyes, and seeing it for the tangled web of psychic forces that it truly is. But the truth is divined long before it is clearly seen, and then begins the long battle of the \"mind,\" against the Real, the \"mind\" fighting doggedly, craftily, for its supremacy.  \n",

      "then there would be an endless series of perceiving Minds, and a confusion of memories.  One of the expedients by which the \"mind\" seeks to deny and thwart the Soul, when it feels that it is beginning to be circumvented and seen through, is to assert that this seeing is the work of a part of itself, one part observing the other, and thus leaving no need nor place for the Spiritual Man.  To this strategy the argument is opposed by our philosopher, that this would be no true solution, but only a postponement of the solution. For we should have to find yet another part of the mind to view the first observing part, and then another to observe this, and so on, endlessly.  The true solution is, that the Spiritual Man looks down upon the psychic nature, and observes it; when he views the psychic pictures gallery, this is \"memory,\" which would be a hopeless, inextricable confusion, if we thought of one part of the \"mind,\" with its memories, viewing another part, with memories of its own.  The solution of the mystery lies not in the \"mind\" but beyond it, in the luminous life of the risen Lord, the Spiritual Man.  \n",

We are considering a stage of spiritual life at which the psychical nature has been cleansed and purified. Formerly, it reflected in its plastic substance the images of the earthy; purified now, it reflects the image of the heavenly, giving the spiritual intelligence a visible form. The Self, beholding that visible form, in which its spiritual intelligence has, as it were, taken palpable shape, thereby reaches self-recognition, self-comprehension. The Self sees itself in this mirror, and thus becomes not only conscious, but self-conscious. This is, from one point of view, the purpose of the whole evolutionary process.  \n",

The sensation of sweet things tasted clamours to be renewed, and drives the man into effort to obtain its renewal; so he adds image to image, each dynamic and importunate, piling up sin's intolerable burden.  Then comes regeneration, and the washing away of sin, through the fiery, creative power of the Soul, which burns out the stains of the psychic vesture, purifying it as gold is refined in the furnace. The suffering of regeneration springs from this indispensable purifying.  Then the psychic vesture begins to take on the colour of the Soul, no longer stained, but suffused with golden light; and the man red generate gleams with the radiance of eternity.

The remedy is sacrifice of self, obedience, humility; that purity of heart which gives the vision of God. Thereafter, he who has attained is wrapt about with the essence of all that can be known, as with a cloud; he has that perfect illumination which is the true spiritual consciousness. Through obedience to the will of God, he comes into oneness of being with God; he is initiated into God's view of the universe, seeing all life as God sees it.  \n",

Free from self-will, he is free from sorrow, too, for sorrow comes from the fight of self-will against the divine will, through the correcting stress of the divine will, which seeks to counteract the evil wrought by disobedience. When the conflict with the divine will ceases, then sorrow ceases, and he who has grown into obedience, thereby enters into joy.  \n",

It is a part of the beauty and wisdom of the great Indian teachings, the Vedanta and the Yoga alike, to hold that all life exists for the purposes of Soul, for the making of the spiritual man. They teach that all nature is an orderly process of evolution, leading up to this, designed for this end, existing only for this: to bring forth and perfect the Spiritual Man. He is the crown of evolution: at his coming, the goal of all development is attained.  \n",

There are two kinds of eternity, says the commentary: the eternity of immortal life, which belongs to the Spirit, and the eternity of change, which inheres in Nature, in all that is not Spirit. While we are content to live in and for Nature, in the Circle of Necessity, Sansara, we doom ourselves to perpetual change. That which is born must die, and that which dies must be reborn. It is change evermore, a ceaseless series of transformations.  But the Spiritual Man enters a new order; for him, there is no longer eternal change, but eternal Being. He has entered into the joy of his Lord. This spiritual birth, which makes him heir of the Everlasting, sets a term to change; it is the culmination, the crowning transformation, of the whole realm of change.  \n",

Here we have a splendid generalization, in which our wise philosopher finally reconciles the naturalists and the idealists, expressing the crown and end of his teaching, first in the terms of the naturalist, and then in the terms of the idealist.  The birth and growth of the Spiritual Man, and his entry into his immortal heritage, may be regarded, says our philosopher, either as the culmination of the whole process of natural evolution and involution, where \"that which flowed from out the boundless deep, turns again home\"; or it may be looked at, as the Vedantins look at it, as the restoration of pure spiritual Consciousness to its pristine and essential form. There is no discrepancy or conflict between these two views, which are but two accounts of the same thing. Therefore those who study the wise philosopher, be they naturalist or idealist, have no excuse to linger over dialectic subtleties or disputes. These things are lifted from their path, lest they should be tempted to delay over them, and they are left facing the path itself, stretching upward and onward from their feet to the everlasting hills, radiant with infinite Light.   \n",

He shall understand a parable and the interpretation, the words of the wise, and their mysterious sayings.  1:7. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

You have despised all my counsel, and have neglected my reprehensions.  1:26. I also will laugh in your destruction, and will mock when that shall come to you which you feared.  1:27.

A stone is heavy, and sand weighty: but the anger of a fool is heavier than them both.  27:4. Anger hath no mercy: nor fury, when it breaketh forth: and who can bear the violence of one provoked?  27:5. Open rebuke is better than hidden love.  27:6. Better are the wounds of a friend, than the deceitful kisses of an enemy.  27:7. A soul that is full shall tread upon the honeycomb: and a soul that is hungry shall take even bitter for sweet.  27:8. As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that leaveth his place.  27:9. Ointment and perfumes rejoice the heart: and the good counsels of a friend are sweet to the soul.  27:10. Thy own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not: and go not into thy brother's house in the day of thy affliction.  Better is a neighbour that is near than a brother afar off.  27:11. Study wisdom, my son, and make my heart joyful, that thou mayst give an answer to him that reproacheth.  27:12. The prudent man seeing evil hideth himself: little ones passing on have suffered losses.  27:13. Take away his garment that hath been surety for a stranger: and take from him a pledge for strangers.  27:14.

As the faces of them that look therein, shine in the water, so the hearts of men are laid open to the wise.  27:20. Hell and destruction are never filled: so the eyes of men are never satisfied.  27:21. As silver is tried in the fining-pot, and gold in the furnace: so a man is tried by the mouth of him that praiseth.  The heart of the wicked seeketh after evils, but the righteous heart seeketh after knowledge.  27:22. Though thou shouldst bray a fool in the mortar, as when a pestle striketh upon sodden barley, his folly would not be taken from him.  27:23. Be diligent to know the countenance of thy cattle, and consider thy own flocks:  27:24. For thou shalt not always have power: but a crown shall be given to generation and generation.  27:25. The meadows are open, and the green herbs have appeared, and the hay is gathered out of the mountains.  27:26. Lambs are for thy clothing: and kids for the price of the field.  27:27.

A poor man that oppresseth the poor, is like a violent shower, which bringeth a famine.  28:4. They that forsake the law, praise the wicked man: they that keep it, are incensed against him.  28:5. Evil men think not on judgment: but they that seek after the Lord, take notice of all things.  28:6. Better is the poor man walking in his simplicity, than the rich in crooked ways.  28:7. He that keepeth the law, is a wise son: but he that feedeth gluttons, shameth his father.  28:8. He that heapeth together riches by usury and loan, gathereth them for him that will be bountiful to the poor.  28:9.

He that hideth his sins, shall not prosper: but he that shall confess, and forsake them, shall obtain mercy.  28:14. Blessed is the man that is always fearful: but he that is hardened in mind shall fall into evil.  28:15. As a roaring lion, and a hungry bear, so is a wicked prince over the poor people.  28:16. A prince void of prudence shall oppress many by calumny: but he that hateth covetousness, shall prolong his days.  28:17.

A faithful man shall be much praised: but he that maketh haste to be rich, shall not be innocent.  28:21. He that hath respect to a person in judgment, doth not well: such a man even for a morsel of bread forsaketh the truth.  28:22. A man that maketh haste to be rich, and envieth others, is ignorant that poverty shall come upon him.  28:23. He that rebuketh a man, shall afterward find favour with him, more than he that by a flattering tongue deceiveth him.  28:24. He that stealeth any thing from his father, or from his mother: and saith, This is no sin, is the partner of a murderer.  28:26. He that boasteth and puffeth up himself, stirreth up quarrels: but he that trusteth in the Lord, shall be healed.  28:26.

      "certain virtues and vices.  30:1. The words of Gatherer the son of Vomiter. The vision which the man spoke, with whom God is, and who being strengthened by God, abiding with him, said:  Gatherer, etc... Or, as it is in the Latin, Congregans the son of Vomens. The Latin interpreter has given us in this place the signification of the Hebrew names, instead of the names themselves, which are in the Hebrew, Agur the son of Jakeh. But whether this Agur be the same person as Solomon, as many think, or a different person, whose doctrine was adopted by Solomon, and inserted among his parables or proverbs, is uncertain.  30:2. I am the most foolish of men, and the wisdom of men is not with me.  30:3. I have not learned wisdom, and have not known the science of saints.  30:4. Who hath ascended up into heaven, and descended?  who hath held the wind in his hands? who hath bound up the waters together as in a garment? who hath raised up all the borders of the earth? what is his name, and what is the name of his son, if thou knowest?  30:5. Every word of God is fire tried: he is a buckler to them that hope in him.  Is fire tried... That is, most pure, like gold purified by fire.  30:6. Add not any thing to his words, lest thou be reproved and found a liar:  30:7. Two things I have asked of thee, deny them not to me before I die.  30:8. Remove far from me vanity, and lying words.  Give me neither beggary, nor riches: give me only the necessaries of life:  30:9. Lest perhaps being filled, I should be tempted to deny, and say: Who is the Lord? or being compelled by poverty, I should steal, and forswear the name of my God.  30:10. Accuse not a servant to his master, lest he curse thee, and thou fall.  30:11. There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.  30:12. A generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet are not washed from their filthiness.  30:13. A generation, whose eyes are lofty, and their eyelids lifted up on high.  30:14. A generation that for teeth hath swords, and grindeth with their jaw teeth, to devour the needy from off the earth, and the poor from among men.  30:15. The horseleech hath two daughters that say: Bring, bring.  There are three things that never are satisfied, and the fourth never saith: It is enough.  The horseleech... Concupiscence, which hath two daughters that are never satisfied, viz., lust and avarice.  30:16. Hell and the mouth of the womb, and the earth which is not satisfied with water: and the fire never saith: It is enough.  30:17. The eye that mocketh at his father, and that despiseth the labour of his mother in bearing him, let the ravens of the brooks pick it out, and the young eagles eat it.  30:18. Three things are hard to me, and the fourth I am utterly ignorant of.  30:19. The way of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent upon a rock, the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man in youth.  30:20. Such also is the way of an adulterous woman, who eateth and wipeth her mouth, and saith: I have done no evil.  30:21. By three things the earth is disturbed, and the fourth it cannot bear.  30:22. By a slave when he reigneth: by a fool when he is filled with meat:  30:23. By an odious woman when she is married: and by a bondwoman when she is heir to her mistress.  30:24. There are four very little things of the earth, and they are wiser than the wise.  30:25. The ants, a feeble people, which provide themselves food in the harvest:  30:26. The rabbit, a weak people, which maketh its bed in the rock:  30:27. The locust hath no king, yet they all go out by their bands:  30:28. The stellio supporteth itself on hands, and dwelleth in kings' houses.  The stellio... A kind of house lizard marked with spots like stars, from whence it has its name.  30:19. There are three things, which go well, and the fourth that walketh happily:  30:30. A lion, the strongest of beasts, who hath no fear of any thing he meeteth:  30:31. A cock girded about the loins: and a ram: and a king, whom none can resist.  30:32. There is that hath appeared a fool after he was lifted up on high: for if he had understood, he would have laid his hand upon his mouth.  30:33. And he that strongly squeezeth the paps to bring out milk, straineth out butter: and he that violently bloweth his nose, bringeth out blood: and he that provoketh wrath, bringeth forth strife.  \n",

This name signifies God with him, and is supposed to have been one of the names of Solomon.  31:2. What, O my beloved, what, O the beloved of my womb, what, O the beloved of my vows?  31:3. Give not thy substance to women, and thy riches to destroy kings.  31:4. Give not to kings, O Lamuel, give not wine to kings: because there is no secret where drunkenness reigneth:  31:5. And lest they drink and forget judgments, and pervert the cause of the children of the poor.  31:6. Give strong drink to them that are sad; and wine to them that are grieved in mind:  31:7. Let them drink, and forget their want, and remember their sorrow no more.  31:8. Open thy mouth for the dumb, and for the causes of all the children that pass.  31:9. Open thy mouth, decree that which is just, and do justice to the needy and poor.  31:10. Who shall find a valiant woman? far, and from the uttermost coasts is the price of her.  31:11. The heart of her husband trusteth in her, and he shall have no need of spoils.  31:12. She will render him good, and not evil all the days of her life.  31:13. She hath sought wool and flax, and hath wrought by the counsel of her hands.  31:14. She is like the merchant's ship, she bringeth her bread from afar.  31:15. And she hath risen in the night, and given a prey to her household, and victuals to her maidens.  31:16. She hath considered a field, and bought it: with the fruit of her hands she hath planted a vineyard.  31:17. She hath girded her loins with strength, and hath strengthened her arm.  31:18. She hath tasted, and seen that her traffic is good: her lamp shall not be put out in the night.  31:19. She hath put out her hand to strong things, and her fingers have taken hold of the spindle.  31:20. She hath opened her hand to the needy, and stretched out her hands to the poor.  31:21. She shall not fear for her house in the cold of snow: for all her domestics are clothed with double garments.  31:22. She hath made for herself clothing of tapestry: fine linen, and purple, is her covering.  31:23. Her husband is honourable in the gates, when he sitteth among the senators of the land.  31:24. She made fine linen, and sold it, and delivered a girdle to the Chanaanite.  The Chanaanite... The merchant, for Chanaanite, in Hebrew, signifies a merchant.  31:25. Strength and beauty are her clothing, and she shall laugh in the latter day.  31:26. She hath opened her mouth to wisdom, and the law of clemency is on her tongue.  31:27. She hath looked well on the paths of her house, and hath not eaten her bread idle.  31:28. Her children rose up, and called her blessed: her husband, and he praised her.  31:29. Many daughters have gathered together riches: thou hast surpassed them all.  31:30. Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: the woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.  31:31.

What hath a man more of all his labour, that he taketh under the sun?  1:4. One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth standeth for ever.  1:5. The sun riseth, and goeth down, and returneth to his place: and there rising again,  1:6. Maketh his round by the south, and turneth again to the north: the spirit goeth forward surveying all places round about, and returneth to his circuits.  1:7. All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea doth not overflow: unto the place from whence the rivers come, they return, to flow again.  1:8. All things are hard: man cannot explain them by word. The eye is not filled with seeing, neither is the ear filled with hearing.  1:9. What is it that hath been? the same thing that shall be. What is it that hath been done? the same that shall be done.  1:10. Nothing under the sun is new, neither is any man able to say: Behold this is new: for it hath already gone before in the ages that were before us.  1:11. There is no remembrance of former things: nor indeed of those things which hereafter are to come, shall there be any remembrance with them that shall be in the latter end.  1:12. I Ecclesiastes was king over Israel in Jerusalem,  1:13. And I proposed in my mind to seek and search out wisely concerning all things that are done under the sun. This painful occupation hath God given to the children of men, to be exercised therein.  1:14. I have seen all things that are done under the sun, and behold all is vanity, and vexation of spirit.  1:15. The perverse are hard to be corrected, and the number of fools is infinite.  1:16. I have spoken in my heart, saying: Behold I am become great, and have gone beyond all in wisdom, that were before me in Jerusalem: and my mind hath contemplated many things wisely, and I have learned.  1:17. And I have given my heart to know prudence, and learning, and errors, and folly: and I have perceived that in these also there was labour, and vexation of spirit,  1:18. Because in much wisdom there is much indignation: and he that addeth knowledge, addeth also labour.  \n",

      " 2:1. I said in my heart: I will go, and abound with delights, and enjoy good things. And I saw that this also was vanity.  2:2. Laughter I counted error: and to mirth I said: Why art thou vainly deceived?  2:3. I thought in my heart, to withdraw my flesh from wine, that I might turn my mind to wisdom, and might avoid folly, till I might see what was profitable for the children of men: and what they ought to do under the sun, all the days of their life.  2:4. I made me great works, I built me houses, and planted vineyards,  2:5. I made gardens, and orchards, and set them with trees of all kinds,  2:6. And I made me ponds of water, to water therewith the wood of the young trees,  2:7. I got me menservants, and maidservants, and had a great family: and herds of oxen, and great flocks of sheep, above all that were before me in Jerusalem:  2:8. I heaped together for myself silver and gold, and the wealth of kings, and provinces: I made me singing men, and singing women, and the delights of the sons of men, cups and vessels to serve to pour out wine:  2:9. And I surpassed in riches all that were before me in Jerusalem: my wisdom also remained with me.  2:10. And whatsoever my eyes desired, I refused them not: and I withheld not my heart from enjoying every pleasure, and delighting itself in the things which I had prepared: and esteemed this my portion, to make use of my own labour.  2:11. And when I turned myself to all the works which my hands had wrought, and to the labours wherein I had laboured in vain, I saw in all things vanity, and vexation of mind, and that nothing was lasting under the sun.  2:12. I passed further to behold wisdom, and errors and folly, (What is man, said I that he can follow the King his maker?)  2:13. And I saw that wisdom excelled folly, as much as light differeth from darkness.  2:14. The eyes of a wise man are in his head: the fool walketh in darkness: and I learned that they were to die both alike.  2:15. And I said in my heart: If the death of the fool and mine shall be one, what doth it avail me, that I have applied myself more to the study of wisdom? And speaking with my own mind, I perceived that this also was vanity.  2:16. For there shall be no remembrance of the wise no more than of the fool forever, and the times to come shall cover all things together with oblivion: the learned dieth in like manner as the unlearned.  2:17. And therefore I was weary of my life, when I saw that all things under the sun are evil, and all vanity and vexation of spirit.  2:18. Again I hated all my application wherewith I had earnestly laboured under the sun, being like to have an heir after me,  2:19. Whom I know not whether he will be a wise man or a fool, and he shall have rule over all my labours with which I have laboured and been solicitous: and is there anything so vain?  2:20. Wherefore I left off and my heart renounced labouring anymore under the sun.  2:21. For when a man laboureth in wisdom, and knowledge, and carefulness, he leaveth what he hath gotten to an idle man: so this also is vanity, and a great evil.  2:22. For what profit shall a man have of all his labour, and vexation of spirit, with which he hath been tormented under the sun?  2:23. All his days are full of sorrows and miseries, even in the night he doth not rest in mind: and is not this vanity?  2:24. Is it not better to eat and drink, and to shew his soul good things of his labours? and this is from the hand of God.  2:25. Who shall so feast and abound with delights as I?  2:26. God hath given to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he hath given vexation, and superfluous care, to heap up and to gather together, and to give it to him that hath pleased God: but this also is vanity, and a fruitless solicitude of the mind.  \n",

A time of war, and a time of peace.  3:9. What hath man more of his labour?  3:10. I have seen the trouble, which God hath given the sons of men to be exercised in it.  3:11. He hath made all things good in their time, and hath delivered the world to their consideration, so that man cannot find out the work which God hath made from the beginning to the end.  3:12. And I have known that there was no better thing than to rejoice, and to do well in this life.  3:13. For every man that eateth and drinketh, and seeth good of his labour, this is the gift of God.  3:14. I have learned that all the works which God hath made, continue for ever: we cannot add any thing, nor take away from those things which God hath made that he may be feared.  3:15. That which hath been made, the same continueth: the things that shall be, have already been: and God restoreth that which is past.  3:16. I saw under the sun in the place of judgment wickedness, and in the place of justice iniquity.  3:17. And I said in my heart: God shall judge both the just and the wicked, and then shall be the time of every thing.  3:18. I said in my heart concerning the sons of men, that God would prove them, and shew them to be like beasts.  3:19. Therefore the death of man, and of beasts is one, and the condition of them both is equal: as man dieth, so they also die: all things breathe alike, and man hath nothing more than beast: all things are subject to vanity.  Man hath nothing more, etc... Viz., as to the life of the body.  3:20. And all things go to one place: of earth they were made, and into earth they return together.  3:21. Who knoweth if the spirit of the children of Adam ascend upward, and if the spirit of the beasts descend downward?  Who knoweth, etc... Viz., experimentally: since no one in this life can see a spirit. But as to the spirit of the beasts, which is merely animal, and become extinct by the death of the beast, who can tell the manner it acts so as to give life and motion, and by death to descend downward, that is, to be no more?  3:22. And I have found that nothing is better than for a man to rejoice in his work, and that this is his portion. For who shall bring him to know the things that shall be after him?  \n",

And I praised the dead rather than the living:  4:3. And I judged him happier than them both, that is not yet born, nor hath seen the evils that are done under the sun.  4:4. Again I considered all the labours of men, and I remarked that their industries are exposed to the envy of their neighbour: so in this also there is vanity, and fruitless care.  4:5. The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh, saying:  4:6. Better is a handful with rest, than both hands full with labour, and vexation of mind.  4:7. Considering I found also another vanity under the sun:  4:8. There is but one, and he hath not a second, no child, no brother, and yet he ceaseth not to labour, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches, neither doth he reflect, saying: For whom do I labour, and defraud my soul of good things? in this also is vanity, and a grievous vexation.  4:9. It is better therefore that two should be together, than one: for they have the advantage of their society:  4:10. If one fall he shall be supported by the other: woe to him that is alone, for when he  falleth, he hath none to lift him up.  4:11. And if two lie together, they shall warm one another: how shall one alone be warmed?  4:12. And if a man prevail against one, two shall withstand him: a threefold cord is not easily broken.  4:13. Better is a child that is poor and wise, than a king that is old and foolish, who knoweth not to foresee for hereafter.  4:14. Because out of prison and chains sometimes a man cometh forth to a kingdom: and another born king is consumed with poverty.  4:15. I saw all men living, that walk under the sun with the second young man, who shall rise up in his place.  4:16. The number of the people, of all that were before him is infinite: and they that shall come afterwards, shall not rejoice in him: but this also is vanity, and vexation of spirit.  4:17. Keep thy foot, when thou goest into the house of God, and draw nigh to hear. For much better is obedience, than the victims of fools, who know not what evil they do.  \n",

      "moderate use of them is the gift of God.  5:1. Speak not any thing rashly, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter a word before God. For God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.  5:2. Dreams follow many cares: and in many words shall be found folly.  5:3. If thou hast vowed any thing to God, defer not to pay it: for an unfaithful and foolish promise displeaseth him: but whatsoever thou hast vowed, pay it.  5:4. And it is much better not to vow, than after a vow not to perform the things promised.  5:5. Give not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin: and say not before the angel: There is no providence: lest God be angry at thy words, and destroy all the works of thy hands.  5:6. Where there are many dreams, there are many vanities, and words without number: but do thou fear God.  5:7. If thou shalt see the oppressions of the poor, and violent judgments, and justice perverted in the province, wonder not at this matter: for he that is high hath another higher, and there are others still higher than these:  5:8. Moreover there is the king that reigneth over all the land subject to him.  5:9. A covetous man shall not be satisfied with money: and he that loveth riches shall reap no fruit from them: so this also is vanity.  5:10. Where there are great riches, there are also many to eat them. And what doth it profit the owner, but that he seeth the riches with his eyes?  5:11. Sleep is sweet to a labouring man, whether he eat little or much: but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.  5:12. There is also another grievous evil, which I have seen under the sun: riches kept to the hurt of the owner.  5:13. For they are lost with very great affliction: he hath begotten a son, who shall be in extremity of want.  5:14. As he came forth naked from his mother's womb, so shall he return, and shall take nothing away with him of his labour.  5:15. A most deplorable evil: as he came, so shall he return. What then doth it profit him that he hath laboured for the wind?  5:16. All the days of his life he eateth in darkness, and in many cares, and in misery, and sorrow.  5:17. This therefore hath seemed good to me, that a man should eat and drink, and enjoy the fruit of his labour, wherewith he hath laboured under the sun, all the days of his life, which God hath given him: and this is his portion.  5:18. And every man to whom God hath given riches, and substance, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to enjoy his portion, and to rejoice of his labour: this is the gift of God.  5:19. For he shall not much remember the days of his life, because God entertaineth his heart with delight.  \n",

      " 6:1. There is also another evil, which I have seen under the sun, and that frequent among men:  6:2. A man to whom God hath given riches, and substance, and honour, and his soul wanteth nothing of all that he desireth: yet God doth not give him power to eat thereof, but a stranger shall eat it up. This is vanity and a great misery.  6:3. If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, and attain to a great age, and his soul make no use of the goods of his substance, and he be without burial: of this man I pronounce, that the untimely born is better than he.  6:4. For he came in vain, and goeth to darkness, and his name shall be wholly forgotten.  6:5. He hath not seen the sun, nor known the distance of good and evil:  6:6. Although he lived two thousand years, and hath not enjoyed good things: do not all make haste to one place?  6:7. All the labour of man is for his mouth, but his soul shall not be filled.  6:8. What hath the wise man more than the fool? and what the poor man, but to go thither, where there is life?  6:9. Better it is to see what thou mayst desire, than to desire that which thou canst not know. But this also is vanity, and presumption of spirit.  6:10. He that shall be, his name is already called: and it is known, that he is a man, and cannot contend in judgment with him that is stronger than himself.  6:11. There are many words that have much vanity in disputing.  \n",

      "seeking wisdom.  7:1. What needeth a man to seek things that are above him, whereas he knoweth not what is profitable for him in his life, in all the days of his pilgrimage, and the time that passeth like a shadow? Or who can tell him what shall be after him under the sun?  7:2. A good name is better than precious ointments: and the day of death than the day of one's birth.  7:3. It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to the house of feasting: for in that we are put in mind of the end of all, and the living thinketh what is to come.  7:4. Anger is better than laughter: because by the sadness of the countenance the mind of the offender is corrected.  Anger... That is, correction, or just wrath and zeal against evil.  7:5. The heart of the wise is where there is mourning, and the heart of fools where there is mirth.  7:6. It is better to be rebuked by a wise man, than to be deceived by the flattery of fools.  7:7. For as the crackling of thorns burning under a pot, so is the laughter of a fool: now this also is vanity.  7:8. Oppression troubleth the wise, and shall destroy the strength of his heart.  7:9. Better is the end of a speech than the beginning. Better is the patient man than the presumptuous.  7:10. Be not quickly angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of a fool.  7:11. Say not: What thinkest thou is the cause that former times were better than they are now? for this manner of question is foolish.  7:12. Wisdom with riches is more profitable, and bringeth more advantage to them that see the sun.  7:13. For as wisdom is a defence, so money is a defence: but learning and wisdom excel in this, that they give life to him that possesseth them.  7:14. Consider the works of God, that no man can correct whom he hath despised.  7:15. In the good day enjoy good things, and beware beforehand of the evil day: for God hath made both the one and the other, that man may not find against him any just complaint.  7:16. These things also I saw in the days of my vanity: A just man perisheth in his justice, and a wicked man liveth a long time in his wickedness.  7:17. Be not over just: and be not more wise than is necessary, lest thou become stupid.  Over just... Viz., By an excessive rigour in censuring the ways of God in bearing with the wicked.  7:18. Be not overmuch wicked: and be not foolish, lest thou die before thy time.  Be not overmuch wicked... That is, lest by the greatness of your sin you leave no room for mercy.  7:19. It is good that thou shouldst hold up the just, yea and from him withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God, neglecteth nothing.  7:20. Wisdom hath strengthened the wise more than ten princes of the city.  7:21. For there is no just man upon earth, that doth good, and sinneth not.  7:22. But do not apply thy heart to all words that are spoken: lest perhaps thou hear thy servant reviling thee.  7:23. For thy conscience knoweth that thou also hast often spoken evil of others.  7:24. I have tried all things in wisdom. I have said: I will be wise: and it departed farther from me,  7:25. Much more than it was: it is a great depth, who shall find it out?  7:26. I have surveyed all things with my mind, to know, and consider, and seek out wisdom and reason: and to know the wickedness of the fool, and the error of the imprudent:  7:27. And I have found a woman more bitter than death, who is the hunter's snare, and her heart is a net, and her hands are bands. He that pleaseth God shall escape from her: but he that is a sinner, shall be caught by her.  7:28. Lo this have I found, said Ecclesiastes, weighing one thing after another, that I might find out the account,  7:29. Which yet my soul seeketh, and I have not found it. One man among a thousand I have found, a woman among them all I have not found.  7:30. Only this I have found, that God made man right, and he hath entangled himself with an infinity of questions. Who is as the wise man? and who hath known the resolution of the word?  Of the word... That is, of this obscure and difficult matter.  Ecclesiastes Chapter 8 \n",

      " 8:1. The wisdom of a man shineth in his countenance, and the most mighty will change his face.  8:2. I observe the mouth of the king, and the commandments of the oath of God.  8:3. Be not hasty to depart from his face, and do not continue in an evil work: for he will do all that pleaseth him:  8:4. And his word is full of power: neither can any man say to him: Why dost thou so?  8:5. He that keepeth the commandment, shall find no evil. The heart of a wiser man understandeth time and answer.  8:6. There is a time and opportunity for every business, and great affliction for man:  8:7. Because he is ignorant of things past, and things to come he cannot know by any messenger.  8:8. It is not in man's power to stop the spirit, neither hath he power in the day of death, neither is he suffered to rest when war is at hand, neither shall wickedness save the wicked.  8:9. All these things I have considered, and applied my heart to all the works that are done under the sun. Sometimes one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.  8:10. I saw the wicked buried: who also when they were yet living were in the holy place, and were praised in the city as men of just works: but this also is vanity.  8:11. For because sentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil, the children of men commit evils without any fear.  8:12. But though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and by patience be borne withal, I know from thence that it shall be well with them that fear God, who dread his face.  8:13. But let it not be well with the wicked, neither let his days be prolonged, but as a shadow let them pass away that fear not the face of the Lord.  8:14. There is also another vanity, which is done upon the earth. There are just men to whom evils happen, as though they had done the works of the wicked: and there are wicked men, who are as secure as though they had the deeds of the just: but this also I judge most vain.  8:15. Therefore I commended mirth, because there was no good for a man under the sun, but to eat, and drink, and be merry, and that he should take nothing else with him of his labour in the days of his life, which God hath given him under the sun.  No good for a man, etc... Some commentators think the wise man here speaks in the person of the libertine: representing the objections of these men against divine providence, and the inferences they draw from thence, which he takes care afterwards to refute. But it may also be said, that his meaning is to commend the moderate use of the goods of this world, preferably to the cares and solicitudes of worldlings, their attachment to vanity and curiosity, and presumptuously diving into the unsearchable ways of divine providence.  8:16. And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to understand the distraction that is upon earth: for there are some that day and night take no sleep with their eyes.  8:17. And I understood that man can find no reason of all those works of God that are done under the sun: and the more he shall labour to seek, so much the less shall he find: yea, though the wise man shall say, that he knoweth it, he shall not be able to find it.  \n",

      "work or merit.  9:1. All these things have I considered in my heart, that I might carefully understand them: there are just men and wise men, and their works are in the hand of God: and yet man knoweth not whether he be worthy of love, or hatred:  9:2. But all things are kept uncertain for the time to come, because all things equally happen to the just and to the wicked, to the good and to the evil, to the clean and to the unclean, to him that offereth victims, and to him that despiseth sacrifices. As the good is, so also is the sinner: as the perjured, so he also that sweareth truth.  9:3. This is a very great evil among all things that are done under the sun, that the same things happen to all men: whereby also the hearts of the children of men are filled with evil, and with contempt while they live, and afterwards they shall be brought down to hell.  9:4. There is no man that liveth always, or that hopeth for this: a living dog is better than a dead lion.  9:5. For the living know that they shall die, but the dead know nothing more, neither have they a reward any more: for the memory of them is forgotten.  Know nothing more... Viz., as to the transactions of this world, in which they have now no part, unless it be revealed to them; neither have they any knowledge or power now of doing any thing to secure their eternal state, (if they have not taken care of it in their lifetime:) nor can they now procure themselves any good, as the living always may do, by the grace of God.  9:6. Their love also, and their hatred, and their envy are all perished, neither have they any part in this world, and in the work that is done under the sun.  9:7. Go then, and eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with gladness: because thy works please God.  9:8. At all times let thy garments be white, and let not oil depart from thy head.  9:9. Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest, all the days of thy unsteady life, which are given to thee under the sun, all the time of thy vanity: for this is thy portion in life, and in thy labour wherewith thou labourest under the sun.  9:10. Whatsoever thy hand is able to do, do it earnestly: for neither work, nor reason, nor wisdom, nor knowledge shall be in hell, whither thou art hastening.  9:11. I turned me to another thing, and I saw that under the sun, the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the learned, nor favour to the skilful: but time and chance in all.  9:12. Man knoweth not his own end: but as fishes are taken with the hook, and as birds are caught with the snare, so men are taken in the evil time, when it shall suddenly come upon them.  9:13. This wisdom also I have seen under the sun, and it seemed to me to be very great:  9:14. A little city, and few men in it: there came against it a great king, and invested it, and built bulwarks round about it, and the siege was perfect.  9:15. Now there was found in it a man poor and wise, and he delivered the city by his wisdom, and no man afterward remembered that poor man.  9:16. And I said that wisdom is better than strength: how then is the wisdom of the poor man slighted, and his words not heard?  9:17. The words of the wise are heard in silence, more than the cry of a prince among fools.  9:18. Better is wisdom, than weapons of war: and he that shall offend in one, shall lose many good things.  \n",

Yea, and the fool when he walketh in the way, whereas he himself is a fool, esteemeth all men fools.  10:4. If the spirit of him that hath power, ascend upon thee, leave not thy place: because care will make the greatest sins to cease.  10:5. There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as it were by an error proceeding from the face of the prince:  10:6. A fool set in high dignity, and the rich sitting beneath.  10:7. I have seen servants upon horses: and princes walking on the ground as servants.  10:8. He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that breaketh a hedge, a serpent shall bite him.  10:9. He that removeth stones, shall be hurt by them: and he that cutteth trees, shall be wounded by them.  10:10. If the iron be blunt, and be not as before, but be made blunt, with much labour it shall be sharpened: and after industry shall follow wisdom.  10:11. If a serpent bite in silence, he is nothing better that backbiteth secretly.  10:12. The words of the mouth of a wise man are grace: but the lips of a fool shall throw him down headlong.  10:13. The beginning of his words is folly, and the end of his talk is a mischievous error.  10:14. A fool multiplieth words. A man cannot tell what hath been before him: and what shall be after him, who can tell him?  10:15. The labour of fools shall afflict them that know not how to go to the city.  10:16. Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and when the princes eat in the morning.  10:17. Blessed is the land, whose king is noble, and whose princes eat in due season for refreshment, and not for riotousness.  10:18. By slothfulness a building shall be brought down, and through the weakness of hands, the house shall drop through.  10:19. For laughter they make bread, and wine that the living may feast: and all things obey money.  10:20.

If the tree fall to the south, or to the north, in what place soever it shall fall, there shall it be.  If the tree fall, etc... The state of the soul is unchangeable when once she comes to heaven or hell: and a soul that departs this life in the state of grace, shall never fall from grace: as on the other side, a soul that dies out of the state of grace, shall never come to it.

He sought profitable words, and wrote words most right, and full of truth.  12:11.

He that loveth God, shall obtain pardon for his sins by prayer, and shall refrain himself from them, and shall be heard in the prayer of days.  3:5.

He that honoureth his father shall enjoy a long life: and he that obeyeth the father, shall be a comfort to his mother.  3:8. He that feareth the Lord, honoureth his parents, and will serve them as his masters that brought him into the world.  3:9. Honour thy father, in work and word, and all patience,  3:10. That a blessing may come upon thee from him, and his blessing may remain in the latter end.  3:11. The father's blessing establisheth the houses of the children: but the mother's curse rooteth up the foundation.  3:12. Glory not in the dishonour of thy father: for his shame is no glory to thee.  3:13. For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father, and a father without honour is the disgrace of the son.  3:14. Son, support the old age of thy father, and grieve him not in his life;  3:15.

My son, do thy works in meekness, and thou shalt be beloved above the glory of men.  3:20. The greater thou art, the more humble thyself in all things, and thou shalt find grace before God:  3:21.

Seek not the things that are too high for thee, and search not into things above thy ability: but the things that God hath commanded thee, think on them always, and in many of his works be not curious.  3:23. For it is not necessary for thee to see with thy eyes those things that are hid.  3:24. In unnecessary matters be not over curious, and in many of his works thou shalt not be inquisitive.  3:25. For many things are shewn to thee above the understanding of men.  3:26. And the suspicion of them hath deceived many, and hath detained their minds in vanity.  3:27.

A wise heart, and which hath understanding, will abstain from sins, and in the works of justice shall have success.  3:33. Water quencheth a flaming fire, and alms resisteth sins:  3:34.

Glory not in apparel at any time, and be not exalted in the day of thy honour: for the works of the Highest only are wonderful, and his works are glorious, and secret, and hidden.  11:5. Many tyrants have sat on the throne, and he whom no man would think on, hath worn the crown.  11:6. Many mighty men have been greatly brought down, and the glorious have been delivered into the hand of others.  11:7. Before thou inquire, blame no man: and when thou hast inquired, reprove justly.  11:8. Before thou hear, answer not a word: and interrupt not others in the midst of their discourse.  11:9. Strive not in a matter which doth not concern thee, and sit not in judgment with sinners.  11:10. My son, meddle not with many matters: and if thou be rich, thou shalt not be free from sin: for if thou pursue after thou shalt not overtake; and if thou run before thou shalt not escape.  11:11. There is an ungodly man that laboureth, and maketh haste, and is in sorrow, and is so much the more in want.  11:12. Again, there is an inactive man that wanteth help, is very weak in ability, and full of poverty:  11:13. Yet the eye of God hath looked upon him for good, and hath lifted him up from his low estate, and hath exalted his head: and many have wondered at him, and have glorified God.  11:14. Good things and evil, life and death, poverty and riches, are from God.  11:15. Wisdom and discipline, and the knowledge of the law are with God. Love and the ways of good things are with him.  11:16. Error and darkness are created with sinners: and they that glory in evil things, grow old in evil.  11:17. The gift of God abideth with the just, and his advancement shall have success for ever.  11:18. There is one that is enriched by living sparingly, and this is the portion of his reward.  11:19. In that he saith: I have found me rest, and now I will eat of my goods alone:  11:20. And he knoweth not what time shall pass, and that death approacheth, and that he must leave all to others, and shall die.  11:21. Be steadfast in thy covenant, and be conversant therein, and grow old in the work of thy commandments.  11:22. Abide not in the works of sinners. But trust in God, and stay in thy place,  11:23. For it is easy in the eyes of God on a sudden to make the poor man rich.  11:24. The blessing of God maketh haste to reward the just, and in a swift hour his blessing beareth fruit.  11:25. Say not: What need I, and what good shall I have by this?  11:26. Say not: I am sufficient for myself: and what shall I be made worse by this?  11:27.

The affliction of an hour maketh one forget great delights, and in the end of a man is the disclosing of his works.  11:30. Praise not any man before death, for a man is known by his children.  11:31. Bring not every man into thy house: for many are the snares of the deceitful.  11:32. For as corrupted bowels send forth stinking breath, and as the partridge is brought into the cage, and as the roe into the snare: so also is the heart of the proud, and as a spy that looketh on the fall of his neighbour.  11:33. For he lieth in wait and turneth good into evil, and on the elect he will lay a blot.  11:34. Of one spark cometh a great fire, and of one deceitful man much blood: and a sinful man lieth in wait for blood.  11:35.

For there is no good for him that is always occupied in evil, and that giveth no alms: for the Highest hateth sinners, and hath mercy on the penitent.  12:4. Give to the merciful and uphold not the sinner: God will repay vengeance to the ungodly and to sinners, and keep them against the day of vengeance.  12:5. Give to the good, and receive not a sinner.  12:6. Do good to the humble, and give not to the ungodly: hold back thy bread, and give it not to him, lest thereby he overmaster thee.  12:7. For thou shalt receive twice as much evil for all the good thou shalt have done to him: for the Highest also hateth sinners, and will repay vengeance to the ungodly.  12:8.

Never trust thy enemy for as a brass pot his wickedness rusteth:  12:11. Though he humble himself and go crouching, yet take good heed and beware of him.  12:12. Set him not by thee, neither let him sit on thy right hand, lest he turn into thy place, and seek to take thy seat and at the last thou acknowledge my words, and be pricked with my sayings.  12:13. Who will pity an enchanter struck by a serpent, or any that come near wild beasts? so is it with him that keepeth company with a wicked man, and is involved in his sins.  12:14. For an hour he will abide with thee: but if thou begin to decline, he will not endure it.  12:15. An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips, but in his heart he lieth in wait, to throw thee into a pit.  12:16. An enemy weepeth with his eyes: but if he find an opportunity he will not be satisfied with blood:  12:17. And if evils come upon thee, thou shalt find him there first.  12:18.

The rich man hath done wrong, and yet he will fume: but the poor is wronged and must hold his peace.  13:5.

And he will shame thee by his meats, till he have drawn thee dry twice or thrice, and at last he will laugh at thee: and afterward when he seeth thee, he will forsake thee, and shake his head at thee.  13:9.

Be not lowly in thy wisdom, lest being humbled thou be deceived into folly.  13:12. If thou be invited by one that is mightier, withdraw thyself: for so he will invite thee the more.  13:13. Be not troublesome to him, lest thou be put back: and keep not far from him, lest thou be forgotten.  13:14. Affect not to speak with him as an equal, and believe not his many words: for by much talk he will sift thee, and smiling will examine thee concerning thy secrets.  13:15. His cruel mind will lay up thy words: and he will not spare to do thee hurt, and to cast thee into prison.  13:16. Take heed to thyself, and attend diligently to what thou hearest: for thou walkest in danger of thy ruin.  13:17.

If the wolf shall at any time have fellowship with the lamb, so the sinner with the just.  13:22. What fellowship hath a holy man with a dog, or what part hath the rich with the poor?  13:23. The wild ass is the lion's prey in the desert: so also the poor are devoured by the rich.  13:24. And as humility is an abomination to the proud: so also the rich man abhorreth the poor.  13:25. When a rich man is shaken, he is kept up by his friends: but when a poor man is fallen down, he is thrust away even by his acquaintance.  13:26. When a rich man hath been deceived, he hath many helpers: he hath spoken proud things, and they have justified him.  13:27. The poor man was deceived, and he is rebuked also: he hath spoken wisely, and could have no place.  13:28.

Rehearse not again a wicked and harsh word, and thou shalt not fare the worse.  19:8. Tell not thy mind to friend or foe: and if there be a sin with thee, disclose it not.  19:9. For he will hearken to thee, and will watch thee, and as it were defending thy sin he will hate thee, and so will he be with thee always.  19:10. Hast thou heard a word against thy neighbour? let it die within thee, trusting that it will not burst thee.  19:11. At the hearing of a word the fool is in travail, as a woman groaning in the bringing forth a child.  19:12. As an arrow that sticketh in a man's thigh: so is a word in the heart of a fool.  19:13. Reprove a friend, lest he may not have understood, and say: I did it not: or if he did it, that he may do it no more.  19:14. Reprove thy neighbour, for it may be he hath not said it: and if he hath said it, that he may not say it again.  19:15. Admonish thy friend: for there is often a fault committed.  19:16. And believe not every word. There is one, that slippeth with the tongue, but not from his heart.  19:17. For who is there that hath not offended with his tongue? Admonish thy neighbour before thou threaten him.  19:18. And give place to the fear of the most High: for the fear of God is all wisdom, and therein is to fear God, and the disposition of the law is in all wisdom.  19:19. But the learning of wickedness is not wisdom: and the device of sinners is not prudence.  19:20. There is a subtle wickedness, and the same is detestable: and there is a man that is foolish, wanting in wisdom.  19:21. Better is a man that hath less wisdom, and wanteth understanding, with the fear of God, than he that aboundeth in understanding, and transgresseth the law of the most High.  19:22. There is an exquisite subtilty, and the same is unjust.  19:23. And there is one that uttereth an exact word telling the truth. There is one that humbleth himself wickedly, and his interior is full of deceit:  19:24. And there is one that submitteth himself exceedingly with a great lowliness: and there is one that casteth down his countenance, and maketh as if he did not see that which is unknown:  19:25. And if he be hindered from sinning for want of power, if he shall find opportunity to do evil, he will do it.  19:26. A man is known by his look, and a wise man, when thou meetest him, is known by his countenance.  19:27. The attire of the body, and the laughter of the teeth, and the gait of the man, shew what he is.  19:28. There is a lying rebuke in the anger of an injurious man: and there is a judgment that is not allowed to be good: and there is one that holdeth his peace, he is wise.  \n",

So is he that by violence executeth of the unwise.  20:4. How good is it, when thou art reproved, to shew repentance!  for so thou shalt escape wilful sin.  20:5. There is one that holdeth his peace, that is found wise: and there is another that is hateful, that is bold in speech.  20:6. There is one that holdeth his peace, because he knoweth not what to say: and there is another that holdeth his peace, knowing the proper time.  20:7. A wise man will hold his peace till he see opportunity: but a babbler, and a fool, will regard no time.  20:8. He that useth many words shall hurt his own soul: and he that taketh authority to himself unjustly shall be hated.  20:9. There is success in evil things to a man without discipline, and there is a finding that turneth to loss.  20:10. There is a gift that is not profitable: and there is a gift, the recompense of which is double.  20:11. There is an abasement because of glory: and there is one that shall lift up his head from a low estate.  20:12. There is that buyeth much for a small price, and restoreth the same sevenfold.  20:13. A man wise in words shall make himself beloved: but the graces of fools shall be poured out.  20:14. The gift of the fool shall do thee no good: for his eyes are sevenfold.  20:15. He will give a few things, and upbraid much: and the opening of his mouth is the kindling of a fire.  20:16. To day a man lendeth, and to morrow he asketh it again: such a man as this is hateful.  20:17. A fool shall have no friend, and there shall be no thanks for his good deeds.  20:18. For they that eat his bread, are of a false tongue. How often, and how many will laugh him to scorn!  20:19. For he doth not distribute with right understanding that which was to be had: in like manner also that which was not to be had.  20:20. The slipping of a false tongue is as one that falleth on the pavement: so the fall of the wicked shall come speedily.  20:21. A man without grace is as a vain fable, it shall be continually in the mouth of the unwise.  20:22. A parable coming out of a fool's mouth shall be rejected: for he doth not speak it in due season.  20:23. There is that is hindered from sinning through want, and in his rest he shall be pricked.  20:24. There is that will destroy his own soul through shamefacedness, and by occasion of an unwise person he will destroy it: and by respect of person he will destroy himself.  20:25. There is that for bashfulness promiseth to his friend, and maketh him his enemy for nothing.  20:26. A lie is a foul blot in a man, and yet it will be continually in the mouth of men without discipline.  20:27. A thief is better than a man that is always lying: but both of them shall inherit destruction.  20:28. The manners of lying men are without honour: and their confusion is with them without ceasing.  20:29. A wise man shall advance himself with his words, and a prudent man shall please the great ones.  20:30. He that tilleth his land shall make a high heap of corn: and he that worketh justice shall be exalted: and he that pleaseth great men shall escape iniquity.  20:31. Presents and gifts blind the eyes of judges, and make them dumb in the mouth, so that they cannot correct.  20:32. O Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is not seen: what profit is there in them both?  20:33. Better is he that hideth his folly, than the man that hideth his wisdom.  \n",

Flee from sins as from the face of a serpent: for if thou comest near them, they will take hold of thee.  21:3. The teeth thereof are the teeth of a lion, killing the souls of men.  21:4. All iniquity is like a two-edged sword, there is no remedy for the wound thereof.  21:5. Injuries and wrongs will waste riches: and the house that is very rich shall be brought to nothing by pride: so the substance of the proud shall be rooted out.  21:6. The prayer out of the mouth of the poor shall reach the ears of God, and judgment shall come for him speedily.  21:7. He that hateth to be reproved walketh in the trace of a sinner: and he that feareth God will turn to his own heart.  21:8. He that is mighty by a bold tongue is known afar off, but a wise man knoweth to slip by him.  21:9. He that buildeth his house at other men's charges, is as he that gathereth himself stones to build in the winter.  21:10. The congregation of sinners is like tow heaped together, and the end of them is a flame of fire.  21:11. The way of sinners is made plain with stones, and in their end is hell, and darkness, and pains.  21:12. He that keepeth justice shall get the understanding thereof.  21:13. The perfection of the fear of God is wisdom and understanding.  21:14. He that is not wise in good, will not be taught.  21:15. But there is a wisdom that aboundeth in evil: and there is no understanding where there is bitterness.  21:16. The knowledge of a wise man shall abound like a flood, and his counsel continueth like a fountain of life.  21:17. The heart of a fool is like a broken vessel, and no wisdom at all shall it hold.  21:18. A man of sense will praise every wise word he shall hear, and will apply it to himself: the luxurious man hath heard it, and it shall displease him, and he will cast it behind his back.  21:19. The talking of a fool is like a burden in the way: but in the lips of the wise, grace shall be found.  21:20. The mouth of the prudent is sought after in the church, and they will think upon his words in their hearts.  21:21. As a house that is destroyed, so is wisdom to a fool: and the knowledge of the unwise is as words without sense.  21:22. Doctrine to a fool is as fetters on the feet, and like manacles on the right hand.  21:23. A fool lifteth up his voice in laughter: but a wise man will scarce laugh low to himself.  21:24. Learning to the prudent is as an ornament of gold, and like a bracelet upon his right arm.  21:25. The foot of a fool is soon in his neighbour's house: but a man of experience will be abashed at the person of the mighty.  21:26. A fool will peep through the window into the house: but he that is well taught will stand without.  21:27. It is the folly of a man to hearken at the door: and a wise man will be grieved with the disgrace.  21:28. The lips of the unwise will be telling foolish things: but the words of the wise shall be weighed in a balance.  21:29. The heart of fools is in their mouth: and the mouth of wise men is in their heart.  21:30. While the ungodly curseth the devil, he curseth his own soul.  While the ungodly, etc... He condemneth and curseth himself: inasmuch as by sin he takes part with the devil, and is, as it were, his member and subject.  21:31.

A son ill taught is the confusion of the father: and a foolish daughter shall be to his loss.  22:4. A wise daughter shall bring an inheritance to her husband: but she that confoundeth, becometh a disgrace to her father.  22:5. She that is bold shameth both her father and husband, and will not be inferior to the ungodly: and shall be disgraced by them both.  22:6. A tale out of time is like music in mourning: but the stripes and instruction of wisdom are never out of time.  22:7. He that teacheth a fool, is like one that glueth a potsherd together.  22:8. He that telleth a word to him that heareth not, is like one that waketh a man out of a deep sleep.  22:9. He speaketh with one that is asleep, who uttereth wisdom to a fool: and in the end of the discourse he saith: Who is this?  22:10. Weep for the dead, for his light hath failed: and weep for the fool, for his understanding faileth.  For the fool... In the language of the Holy Ghost, he is styled a fool, that turns away from God to follow vanity and sin. And what is said by the wise man against fools is meant of such fools as these.  22:11. Weep but a little for the dead, for he is at rest.  22:12. For the wicked life of a wicked fool is worse than death.  22:13. The mourning for the dead is seven days: but for a fool and an ungodly man all the days of their life.  22:14. Talk not much with a fool and go not with him that hath no sense.  22:15. Keep thyself from him, that thou mayst not have trouble, and thou shalt not be defiled with his sin.  22:16. Turn away from him, and thou shalt find rest, and shalt not be wearied out with his folly.  22:17. What is heavier than lead? and what other name hath he but fool?  22:18. Sand and salt, and a mass of iron is easier to bear, than a man without sense, that is both foolish and wicked.  22:19. A frame of wood bound together in the foundation of a building, shall not be loosed: so neither shall the heart that is established by advised counsel.  22:20. The thought of him that is wise at all times, shall not be depraved by fear.  22:21. As pales set in high places, and plasterings made without cost, will not stand against the face of the wind:  22:22. So also a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool shall not resist against the violence of fear.  22:23. As a fearful heart in the thought of a fool at all times will not fear, so neither shall he that continueth always in the commandments of God.  22:24. He that pricketh the eye, bringeth out tears: and he that pricketh the heart, bringeth forth resentment.  22:25. He that flingeth a stone at birds, shall drive them away: so he that upbraideth his friend, breaketh friendship.  22:26. Although thou hast drawn a sword at a friend, despair not: for there may be a returning. To a friend,  22:27. If thou hast opened a sad mouth, fear not, for there may be a reconciliation: except upbraiding, and reproach, and pride, and disclosing of secrets, or a treacherous wound: for in all these cases a friend will flee away.  22:28. Keep fidelity with a friend in his poverty, that in his prosperity also thou mayst rejoice.  22:29. In the time of his trouble continue faithful to him, that thou mayst also be heir with him in his inheritance.  22:30. As the vapour of a chimney, and the smoke of the fire goeth up before the fire: so also injurious words, and reproaches, and threats, before blood.  22:31. I will not be ashamed to salute a friend, neither will I hide myself from his face: and if any evil happen to me by him, I will bear it.  22:32.

      "A prayer for grace to flee sin: cautions against profane swearing and other vices.  23:1. O Lord, father, and sovereign ruler of my life, leave me not to their counsel: nor suffer me to fall by them.  By them... Viz., the tongue and the lips, mentioned in the last verse of the foregoing chapter.  23:2. Who will set scourges over my thoughts, and the discipline of wisdom over my heart, that they spare me not in their ignorances, and that their sins may not appear:  That they spare me not in their ignorances, etc... That is, that the scourges and discipline of wisdom may restrain the ignorances, that is, the slips and offences which are usually committed by the tongue and the lips.  23:3. Lest my ignorances increase, and my offences be multiplied, and my sins abound, and I fall before my adversaries, and my enemy rejoice over me?  23:4. O Lord, father, and God of my life, leave me not to their devices.  23:5. Give me not haughtiness of my eyes, and turn away from me all coveting.  23:6. Take from me the greediness of the belly, and let not the lusts of the flesh take hold of me, and give me not over to a shameless and foolish mind.  23:7. Hear, O ye children, the discipline of the mouth, and he that will keep it shall not perish by his lips, nor be brought to fall into most wicked works.  23:8. A sinner is caught in his own vanity, and the proud and the evil speakers shall fall thereby.  23:9. Let not thy mouth be accustomed to swearing: for in it there are many falls.  23:10. And let not the naming of God be usual in thy mouth, and meddle not with the names of saints, for thou shalt not escape free from them.  23:11. For as a slave daily put to the question, is never without a blue mark: so every one that sweareth, and nameth, shall not be wholly pure from sin.  23:12. A man that sweareth much, shall be filled with iniquity, and a scourge shall not depart from his house.  23:13. And if he make it void, his sin shall be upon him, and if he dissemble it, he offendeth double:  23:14. And if he swear in vain, he shall not be justified: for his house shall be filled with his punishment.  23:15. There is also another speech opposite to death, let it not be found in the inheritance of Jacob.  23:16. For from the merciful all these things shall be taken away, and they shall not wallow in sins.  23:17. Let not thy mouth be accustomed to indiscreet speech: for therein is the word of sin.  23:18. Remember thy father and thy mother, for thou sittest in the midst of great men:  23:19. Lest God forget thee in their sight, and thou, by thy daily custom be infatuated and suffer reproach: and wish that thou hadst not been born, and curse the day of thy nativity.  23:20. The man that is accustomed to opprobrious words, will never be corrected all the days of his life.  23:21. Two sorts of men multiply sins, and the third bringeth wrath and destruction.  23:22. A hot soul is a burning fire, it will never be quenched, till it devour some thing.  23:23. And a man that is wicked in the mouth of his flesh, will not leave off till he hath kindled a fire.  23:24. To a man that is a fornicator all bread is sweet, he will not be weary of sinning unto the end.  23:25. Every man that passeth beyond his own bed, despising his own soul, and saying: Who seeth me?  23:26. Darkness compasseth me about, and the walls cover me, and no man seeth me: whom do I fear? the most High will not remember my sins.  23:27. And he understandeth not that his eye seeth all things, for such a man's fear driveth him from the fear of God, and the eyes of men fearing him:  23:28. And he knoweth not that the eyes of the Lord are far brighter than the sun, beholding round about all the ways of men, and the bottom of the deep, and looking into the hearts of men, into the most hidden parts.  23:29. For all things were known to the Lord God, before they were created: so also after they were perfected he beholdeth all things.  23:30. This man shall be punished in the streets of the city, and he shall be chased as a colt: and where he suspected not, he shall be taken.  23:31. And he shall be in disgrace with all men, because he understood not the fear of the Lord.  23:32. So every woman also that leaveth her husband, and bringeth in an heir by another:  23:33. For first she hath been unfaithful to the law of the most High: and secondly, she hath offended against her husband: thirdly, she hath fornicated in adultery, and hath gotten her children of another man.  23:34. This woman shall be brought into the assembly, and inquisition shall be made of her children.  23:35. Her children shall not take root, and her branches shall bring forth no fruit.  23:36. She shall leave her memory to be cursed, and her infamy shall not be blotted out.  23:37. And they that remain shall know, that there is nothing better than the fear of God: and that there is nothing sweeter than to have regard to the commandments of the Lord.  23:38.

I made that in the heavens there should rise light that never faileth, and as a cloud I covered all the earth:  24:7. I dwelt in the highest places, and my throne is in a pillar of a cloud.  24:8. I alone have compassed the circuit of heaven, and have penetrated into the bottom of the deep, and have walked in the waves of the sea,  24:9. And have stood in all the earth: and in every people,  24:10. And in every nation I have had the chief rule:  24:11. And by my power I have trodden under my feet the hearts of all the high and low: and in all these I sought rest, and I shall abide in the inheritance of the Lord.  24:12. Then the creator of all things commanded, and said to me: and he that made me, rested in my tabernacle,  24:13. And he said to me: Let thy dwelling be in Jacob, and thy inheritance in Israel, and take root in my elect.  24:14. From the beginning, and before the world, was I created, and unto the world to come I shall not cease to be, and in the holy dwelling place I have ministered before him.  24:15. And so was I established in Sion, and in the holy city likewise I rested, and my power was in Jerusalem.  24:16. And I took root in an honourable people, and in the portion of my God his inheritance, and my abode is in the full assembly of saints.  24:17. I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress tree on mount Sion.  24:18. I was exalted like a palm tree in Cades, and as a rose plant in Jericho:  24:19. As a fair olive tree in the plains, and as a plane tree by the water in the streets, was I exalted.  24:20. I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon, and aromatical balm: I yielded a sweet odour like the best myrrh:  24:21. And I perfumed my dwelling as storax, and galbanum, and onyx, and aloes, and as the frankincense not cut, and my odour is as the purest balm.  24:22. I have stretched out my branches as the turpentine tree, and my branches are of honour and grace.  24:23. As the vine I have brought forth a pleasant odour: and my flowers are the fruit of honour and riches.  24:24. I am the mother of fair love, and of fear, and of knowledge, and of holy hope.  24:25. In me is all grace of the way and of the truth, in me is all hope of life and of virtue.  24:26. Come over to me, all ye that desire me, and be filled with my fruits.  24:27. For my spirit is sweet above honey, and my inheritance above honey and the honeycomb.  24:28.  My memory is unto everlasting generations.  24:29.

They that explain me shall have life everlasting.  24:32. All these things are the book of life, and the covenant of the most High, and the knowledge of truth.  24:33. Moses commanded a law in the precepts of justices, and an inheritance to the house of Jacob, and the promises to Israel.  24:34. He appointed to David his servant to raise up of him a most mighty king, and sitting on the throne of glory for ever.  A most mighty king... Viz., Christ, who by his gospel, like an overflowing river, has enriched the earth with heavenly wisdom.  24:35.

Who maketh understanding to abound as the Euphrates, who multiplieth it as the Jordan in the time of harvest.  24:37.

Who first hath perfect knowledge of her... Christ was the first that had perfect knowledge of heavenly wisdom.  24:39.

I said: I will water my garden of plants, and I will water abundantly the fruits of my meadow.  24:43. And behold my brook became a great river, and my river came near to a sea:  24:44.

A poor man that is proud: a rich man that is a liar: an old man that is a fool, and doting.  25:5. The things that thou hast not gathered in thy youth, how shalt thou find them in thy old age?  25:6. O how comely is judgment for a grey head, and for ancients to know counsel!  25:7. O how comely is wisdom for the aged, and understanding and counsel to men of honour!  25:8. Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory.  25:9. Nine things that are not to be imagined by the heart have I magnified, and the tenth I will utter to men with my tongue.  25:10.

Blessed is he that dwelleth with a wise woman, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served such as are unworthy of him.  25:12. Blessed is he that findeth a true friend, and that declareth justice to an ear that heareth.  25:13. How great is he that findeth wisdom and knowledge! but there is none above him that feareth the Lord.  25:14. The fear of God hath set itself above all things:  25:15. Blessed is the man, to whom it is given to have the fear of God: he that holdeth it, to whom shall he be likened?  25:16. The fear of God is the beginning of his love: and the beginning of faith is to be fast joined unto it.  25:17. The sadness of the heart is every plague: and the wickedness of a woman is all evil.  25:18. And a man will choose any plague, but the plague of the heart:  25:19. And any wickedness, but the wickedness of a woman:  25:20. And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate him:  25:21. And any revenge, but the revenge of enemies.  25:22. There is no head worse than the head of a serpent:  25:23. And there is no anger above the anger of a woman. It will be more agreeable to abide with a lion and a dragon, than to dwell with a wicked woman.  25:24. The wickedness of a woman changeth her face: and she darkeneth her countenance as a bear: and sheweth it like sackcloth. In the midst of her neighbours,  25:25. Her husband groaned, and hearing he sighed a little.  25:26. All malice is short to the malice of a woman, let the lot of sinners fall upon her.  25:27. As the climbing of a sandy way is to the feet of the aged, so is a wife full of tongue to a quiet man.  25:28. Look not upon a woman's beauty, and desire not a woman for beauty.  25:29. A woman's anger, and impudence, and confusion is great.  25:30. A woman, if she have superiority, is contrary to her husband.  25:31. A wicked woman abateth the courage, and maketh a heavy countenance, and a wounded heart.  25:32. Feeble hands, and disjointed knees, a woman that doth not make her husband happy.  25:33. From the woman came the beginning of sin, and by her we all die.  25:34. Give no issue to thy water, no, not a little: nor to a wicked woman liberty to gad abroad.  25:35. If she walk not at thy hand, she will confound thee in the sight of thy enemies.  25:36. Cut her off from thy flesh, lest she always abuse thee.  \n",

A good wife is a good portion, she shall be given in the portion of them that fear God, to a man for his good deeds.  26:4. Rich or poor, if his heart is good, his countenance shall be cheerful at all times.  26:5. Of three things my heart hath been afraid, and at the fourth my face hath trembled:  26:6. The accusation of a city, and the gathering together of the people:  26:7. And a false calumny, all are more grievous than death.  26:8. A jealous woman is the grief and mourning of the heart.  26:9. With a jealous woman is a scourge of the tongue which communicateth with all.  26:10. As a yoke of oxen that is moved to and fro, so also is a wicked woman: he that hath hold of her, is as he that taketh hold of a scorpion.  26:11. A drunken woman is a great wrath: and her reproach and shame shall not be hid.  26:12. The fornication of a woman shall be known by the haughtiness of her eyes and by her eyelids.  26:13. On a daughter that turneth not away herself, set a strict watch: lest finding an opportunity she abuse herself.  26:14. Take heed of the impudence of her eyes, and wonder not if she slight thee.  26:15. She will open her mouth as a thirsty traveller to the fountain, and will drink of every water near her, and will sit down by every hedge, and open her quiver against every arrow, until she fail.  26:16. The grace of a diligent woman shall delight her husband, and shall fat his bones.  26:17. Her discipline is the gift of God.  26:18. Such is a wise and silent woman, and there is nothing so much worth as a well instructed soul.  26:19. A holy and shamefaced woman is grace upon grace.  26:20. And no price is worthy of a continent soul.  26:21. As the sun when it riseth to the world in the high places of God, so is the beauty of a good wife for the ornament of her house.  26:22. As the lamp shining upon the holy candlestick, so is the beauty of the face in a ripe age,  26:23. As golden pillars upon bases of silver, so are the firm feet upon the soles of a steady woman.  26:24. As everlasting foundations upon a solid rock, so the commandments of God in the heart of a holy woman.  26:25. At two things my heart is grieved, and the third bringeth anger upon me.  26:26. A man of war fainting through poverty, and a man of sense despised:  26:27. And he that passeth over from justice to sin, God hath prepared such an one for the sword.  26:28. Two sorts of callings have appeared to me hard and dangerous: a merchant is hardly free from negligence: and a huckster shall not be justified from the sins of the lips.  From negligence... That is, from the neglect of the service of God: because the eager pursuit of the mammon of this world, is apt to make men of that calling forget the great duties of loving God above all things, and their neighbours as themselves.-Ibid. A huckster... Or, a retailer of wine. Men of that profession are both greatly exposed to danger of sin themselves, and are too often accessary to the sins of others.  \n",

Unless thou hold thyself diligently in the fear of the Lord, thy house shall quickly be overthrown.  27:5. As when one sifteth with a sieve, the dust will remain: so will the perplexity of a man in his thoughts.  27:6. The furnace trieth the potter's vessels, and the trial of affliction just men.  27:7. As the dressing of a tree sheweth the fruit thereof, so a word out of the thought of the heart of man.  27:8. Praise not a man before he speaketh, for this is the trial of men.  27:9. If thou followest justice, thou shalt obtain her: and shalt put her on as a long robe of honour, and thou shalt dwell with her: and she shall protect thee for ever, and in the day of acknowledgment thou shalt find a strong foundation.  27:10. Birds resort unto their like: so truth will return to them that practise her.  27:11. The lion always lieth in wait for prey: so do sins for them that work iniquities.  27:12. A holy man continueth in wisdom as the sun: but a fool is changed as the moon.  27:13. In the midst of the unwise keep in the word till its time: but be continually among men that think.  27:14. The discourse of sinners is hateful, and their laughter is at the pleasures of sin.  27:15. The speech that sweareth much shall make the hair of the head stand upright: and its irreverence shall make one stop his ears.  27:16. In the quarrels of the road is the shedding of blood: and their cursing is a grievous hearing.  27:17. He that discloseth the secret of a friend loseth his credit, and shall never find a friend to his mind.  27:18. Love thy neighbour, and be joined to him with fidelity.  27:19. But if thou discover his secrets, follow no more after him.  27:20. For as a man that destroyeth his friend, so is he that destroyeth the friendship of his neighbour.  27:21. And as one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so hast thou let thy neighbour go, and thou shalt not get him again.  27:22. Follow after him no more, for he is gone afar off, he is fled, as a roe escaped out of the snare because his soul is wounded.  27:23. Thou canst no more bind him up. And of a curse there is reconciliation:  And of a curse there is reconciliation... That is, it is easier to obtain a reconciliation after a curse, than after disclosing a secret.  27:24. But to disclose the secrets of a friend, leaveth no hope to an unhappy soul.  27:25. He that winketh with the eye forgeth wicked things, and no man will cast him off:  27:26. In the sight of thy eyes he will sweeten his mouth, and will admire thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and on thy words he will lay a stumblingblock.  27:27.

He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that setteth a stone for his neighbour, shall stumble upon it: and he that layeth a snare for another, shall perish in it.  27:30. A mischievous counsel shall be rolled back upon the author, and he shall not know from whence it cometh to him.  27:31. Mockery and reproach are of the proud, and vengeance as a lion shall lie in wait for him.  27:32.

He hath no mercy on a man like himself, and doth he entreat for his own sins?  28:5. He that is but flesh, nourisheth anger, and doth he ask forgiveness of God? who shall obtain pardon for his sins?  28:6. Remember thy last things, and let enmity cease:  28:7. For corruption and death hang over in his commandments.  In his commandments... Supply the sentence out of the Greek thus: Remember corruption and death, and abide in the commandments.  28:8. Remember the fear of God, and be not angry with thy neighbour.  28:9. Remember the covenant of the most High, and overlook the ignorance of thy neighbour.  28:10. Refrain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sins.  28:11. For a passionate man kindleth strife, and a sinful man will trouble his friends, and bring in debate in the midst of them that are at peace.  28:12.

A hasty contention kindleth a fire and a hasty quarrel sheddeth blood and a tongue that beareth witness bringeth death.  28:14. If thou blow the spark, it shall burn as a fire: and if thou spit upon it, it shall be quenched: both come out of the mouth.  28:15. The whisperer and the double tongue is accursed: for he hath troubled many that were at peace.  28:16. The tongue of a third person hath disquieted many, and scattered them from nation to nation.  28:17. It hath destroyed the strong cities of the rich, and hath overthrown the houses of great men.  28:18. It hath cut in pieces the forces of people, and undone strong nations.  28:19. The tongue of a third person hath cast out valiant women, and deprived them of their labours.  28:20. He that hearkeneth to it, shall never have rest, neither shall he have a friend in whom he may repose.  28:21. The stroke of a whip maketh a blue mark: but the stroke of the tongue will break the bones.  28:22. Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but not so many as have perished by their own tongue.  28:23. Blessed is he that is defended from a wicked tongue, that hath not passed into the wrath thereof, and that hath not drawn the yoke thereof, and hath not been bound in its bands.  28:24. For its yoke is a yoke of iron: and its bands are bands of brass.  28:25. The death thereof is a most evil death: and hell is preferable to it.  28:26. Its continuance shall not be for a long time, but it shall possess the ways of the unjust: and the just shall not be burnt with its flame.  28:27.

Keep thy word, and deal faithfully with him: and thou shalt always find that which is necessary for thee.  29:4. Many have looked upon a thing lent as a thing found, and have given trouble to them that helped them.  29:5. Till they receive, they kiss the hands of the lender, and in promises they humble their voice:  29:6. But when they should repay, they will ask time, and will return tedious and murmuring words, and will complain of the time:  29:7. And if he be able to pay, he will stand off, he will scarce pay one half, and will count it as if he had found it:  29:8. But if not, he will defraud him of his money, and he shall get him for an enemy without cause.  29:9. And he will pay him with reproaches and curses, and instead of honour and good turn will repay him injuries.  29:10. Many have refused to lend, not out of wickedness, but they were afraid to be defrauded without cause.  29:11. But yet towards the poor be thou more hearty, and delay not to shew him mercy.  29:12.

It shall fight for thee against thy enemy.  29:18. A good man is surety for his neighbour: and he that hath lost shame, will leave him to himself.  29:19. Forget not the kindness of thy surety: for he hath given his life for thee.  29:20. The sinner and the unclean fleeth from his surety.  29:21. A sinner attributeth to himself the goods of his surety: and he that is of an unthankful mind will leave him that delivered him.  29:22. A man is surety for his neighbour: and when he hath lost all shame, he shall forsake him.  29:23. Evil suretyship hath undone many of good estate, and hath tossed them as a wave of the sea.  29:24. It hath made powerful men to go from place to place round about, and they have wandered in strange countries.  29:25. A sinner that transgresseth the commandment of the Lord, shall fall into an evil suretyship: and he that undertaketh many things, shall fall into judgment.  29:26. Recover thy neighbour according to thy power, and take heed to thyself that thou fall not.  29:27. The chief thing for man's life is water and bread, and clothing, and a house to cover shame.  29:28.

There is no riches above the riches of the health of the body: and there is no pleasure above the joy of the heart.  30:17.

And I awaked last of all, and as one that gathereth after the grapegatherers.  33:17. In the blessing of God I also have hoped: and as one that gathereth grapes, have I filled the winepress.  33:18. See that I have not laboured for myself only, but for all that seek discipline.  33:19. Hear me, ye great men, and all ye people, and hearken with your ears, ye rulers of the church.  33:20. Give not to son or wife, brother or friend, power over thee while thou livest; and give not thy estate to another, lest thou repent, and thou entreat for the same.  33:21. As long as thou livest, and hast breath in thee, let no man change thee.  Change thee... That is, so as to have this power over thee.  33:22. For it is better that thy children should ask of thee, than that thou look toward the hands of thy children.  33:23. In all thy works keep the pre-eminence.  The pre-eminence... That is, be master in thy own house, and part not with thy authority.  33:24. Let no stain sully thy glory. In the time when thou shalt end the days of thy life, and in the time of thy decease, distribute thy inheritance.  33:25. Fodder, and a wand, and a burden are for an ass: bread, and correction, and work for a slave.  33:26. He worketh under correction, and seeketh to rest: let his hands be idle, and he seeketh liberty.  33:27. The yoke and the thong bend a stiff neck, and continual labours bow a slave.  33:28. Torture and fetters are for a malicious slave: send him to work, that he be not idle:  33:29. For idleness hath taught much evil.  33:30. Set him to work: for so it is fit for him. And if he be not obedient, bring him down with fetters, but be not excessive towards any one, and do no grievous thing without judgment.  33:31. If thou have a faithful servant, let him be to thee as thy own soul: treat him as a brother: because in the blood of thy soul thou hast gotten him.  33:32. If thou hurt him unjustly, he will run away:  33:33. And if he rise up and depart, thou knowest not whom to ask, and in what way to seek him.  \n",

The man that giveth heed to lying visions, is like to him that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the wind.  34:3. The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another: as when a man's likeness is before the face of a man.  34:4. What can be made clean by the unclean? and what truth can come from that which is false?  34:5. Deceitful divinations and lying omens and the dreams of evildoers, are vanity:  34:6. And the heart fancieth as that of a woman in travail: except it be a vision sent forth from the most High, set not thy heart upon them.  34:7. For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put their trust in them.  34:8. The word of the law shall be fulfilled without a lie, and wisdom shall be made plain in the mouth of the faithful.  34:9. What doth he know, that hath not been tried? A man that hath much experience, shall think of many things: and he that hath learned many things, shall shew forth understanding.  34:10. He that hath no experience, knoweth little: and he that hath been experienced in many things, multiplieth prudence.  34:11. He that hath not been tried, what manner of things doth he know? he that hath been surprised, shall abound with subtlety.  34:12. I have seen many things by travelling, and many customs of things.  34:13. Sometimes I have been in danger of death for these things, and I have been delivered by the grace of God.  34:14. The spirit of those that fear God, is sought after, and by his regard shall be blessed.  34:15. For their hope is on him that saveth them, and the eyes of God are upon them that love him.  34:16. He that feareth the Lord shall tremble at nothing, and shall not be afraid: for he is his hope.  34:17. The soul of him that feareth the Lord is blessed.  34:18. To whom doth he look, and who is his strength?  34:19. The eyes of the Lord are upon them that fear him, he is their powerful protector, and strong stay, a defence from the heat, and a cover from the sun at noon,  34:20. A preservation from stumbling, and a help from falling: he raiseth up the soul, and enlighteneth the eyes, and giveth health, and life, and blessing.  34:21. The offering of him that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, is stained, and the mockeries of the unjust are not acceptable.  34:22. The Lord is only for them that wait upon him in the way of truth and justice.  34:23. The most High approveth not the gifts of the wicked: neither hath he respect to the oblations of the unjust, nor will he be pacified for sins by the multitude of their sacrifices.  34:24. He that offereth sacrifice of the goods of the poor, is as one that sacrificeth the son in the presence of his father.  34:25. The bread of the needy, is the life of the poor: he that defraudeth them thereof, is a man of blood.  34:26. He that taketh away the bread gotten by sweat, is like him that killeth his neighbour.  34:27. He that sheddeth blood, and he that defraudeth the laborer of his hire, are brothers.  34:28. When one buildeth up, and another pulleth down: what profit have they but the labour?  34:29. When one prayeth, and another curseth: whose voice will God hear?  34:30. He that washeth himself after touching the dead, if he toucheth him again, what doth his washing avail?  34:31. So a man that fasteth for his sins, and doth the same again, what doth his humbling himself profit him? who will hear his prayer?  Ecclesiasticus Chapter 35 \n",

      "35:1. He that keepeth the law, multiplieth offerings.  35:2. It is a wholesome sacrifice to take heed to the commandments, and to depart from all iniquity.  35:3. And to depart from injustice, is to offer a propitiatory sacrifice for injustices, and a begging of pardon for sins.  35:4. He shall return thanks, that offereth fine flour: and he that doth mercy, offereth sacrifice.  35:5. To depart from iniquity is that which pleaseth the Lord, and to depart from injustice, is an entreaty for sins.  35:6. Thou shalt not appear empty in the sight of the Lord.  35:7. For all these things are to be done because of the commandment of God.  35:8. The oblation of the just maketh the altar fat, and is an odour of sweetness in the sight of the most High.  35:9. The sacrifice of the just is acceptable, and the Lord will not forget the memorial thereof.  35:10. Give glory to God with a good heart: and diminish not the firstfruits of thy hands.  35:11. In every gift shew a cheerful countenance, and sanctify thy tithes with joy.  35:12. Give to the most High according to what he hath given to thee, and with a good eye do according to the ability of thy hands:  35:13. For the Lord maketh recompense, and will give thee seven times as much.  35:14. Do not offer wicked gifts, for such he will not receive.  35:15. And look not upon an unjust sacrifice, for the Lord is judge, and there is not with him respect of person.  35:16. The Lord will not accept any person against a poor man, and he will hear the prayer of him that is wronged.  35:17. He will not despise the prayers of the fatherless: nor the widow, when she poureth out her complaint.  35:18. Do not the widow's tears run down the cheek, and her cry against him that causeth them to fall?  35:19. For from the cheek they go up even to heaven, and the Lord that heareth will not be delighted with them.  35:20. He that adoreth God with joy, shall be accepted, and his prayer shall approach even to the clouds.  35:21. The prayer of him that humbleth himself, shall pierce the clouds: and till it come nigh he will not be comforted: and he will not depart till the most High behold.  35:22. And the Lord will not be slack, but will judge for the just, and will do judgment: and the Almighty will not have patience with them, that he may crush their back:  35:23. And he will repay vengeance to the Gentiles, till he have taken away the multitude of the proud, and broken the sceptres of the unjust,  35:24. Till he have rendered to men according to their deeds: and according to the works of Adam, and according to his presumption,  35:25. Till he have judged the cause of his people, and he shall delight the just with his mercy.  35:26.

Lift up thy hand over the strange nations, that they may see thy power.  36:4. For as thou hast been sanctified in us in their sight, so thou shalt be magnified among them in our presence,  36:5. That they may know thee, as we also have known thee, that there is no God beside thee, O Lord.  36:6. Renew thy signs, and work new miracles.  36:7. Glorify thy hand, and thy right arm.  36:8. Raise up indignation, and pour out wrath.  36:9. Take away the adversary, and crush the enemy.  36:10. Hasten the time, and remember the end, that they may declare thy wonderful works.  36:11. Let him that escapeth be consumed by the rage of the fire: and let them perish that oppress thy people.  36:12. Crush the head of the princes of the enemies that say: There is no other beside us.  36:13. Gather together all the tribes of Jacob: that they may know that there no God besides thee, and may declare thy great works: and thou shalt inherit them as from the beginning.  36:14. Have mercy on thy people, upon whom thy name is invoked: and upon Israel, whom thou hast raised up to be thy firstborn.  36:15. Have mercy on Jerusalem, the city which thou hast sanctified, the city of thy rest.  36:16. Fill Sion with thy unspeakable words, and thy people with thy glory.  36:17. Give testimony to them that are thy creatures from the beginning, and raise up the prophecies which the former prophets spoke in thy name.  36:18. Reward them that patiently wait for thee, that thy prophets may be found faithful: and hear the prayers of thy servants,  36:19. According to the blessing of Aaron over thy people, and direct us into the way of justice, and let all know that dwell upon the earth, that thou art God the beholder of all ages.  36:20. The belly will devour all meat, yet one is better than another.  36:21. The palate tasteth venison and the wise heart false speeches.  36:22. A perverse heart will cause grief, and a man of experience will resist it.  36:23. A woman will receive every man: yet one daughter is better than another.  A woman will receive every man... That is, any man that her parents propose to her to marry, though she does not like him, but marries in obedience to her parents, who make the choice for her.  36:24. The beauty of a woman cheereth the countenance of her husband, and a man desireth nothing more.  36:25. If she have a tongue that can cure, and likewise mitigate and shew mercy: her husband is not like other men.  36:26. He that possesseth a good wife, beginneth a possession: she is a help like to himself, and a pillar of rest.  36:27. Where there is no hedge, the possession shall be spoiled: and where there is no wife, he mourneth that is in want.  36:28.

But a companion and a friend shall be turned to an enemy.  37:3. O wicked presumption, whence camest thou to cover the earth with thy malice, and deceitfulness?  37:4. There is a companion who rejoiceth with his friend in his joys, but in the time of trouble, he will be against him.  37:5. There is a companion who condoleth with his friend for his belly's sake, and he will take up a shield against the enemy.  37:6. Forget not thy friend in thy mind, and be not unmindful of him in thy riches.  37:7. Consult not with him that layeth a snare for thee, and hide thy counsel from them that envy thee.  37:8. Every counsellor giveth out counsel, but there is one that is a counsellor for himself.  37:9. Beware of a counsellor. And know before what need he hath: for he will devise to his own mind:  37:10. Lest he thrust a stake into the ground, and say to thee:  37:11. Thy way is good; and then stand on the other side to see what shall befall thee.  37:12. Treat not with a man without religion concerning holiness, nor with an unjust man concerning justice, nor with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous, nor with a coward concerning war, nor with a merchant about traffic, nor with a buyer of selling, nor with an envious man of giving thanks,  37:13. Nor with the ungodly of piety, nor with the dishonest of honesty, nor with the field laborer of every work,  37:14. Nor with him that worketh by the year of the finishing of the year, nor with an idle servant of much business: give no heed to these in any matter of counsel.  37:15. But be continually with a holy man, whomsoever thou shalt know to observe the fear of God,  37:16. Whose soul is according to thy own soul: and who, when thou shalt stumble in the dark, will be sorry for thee.  37:17. And establish within thyself a heart of good counsel: for there is no other thing of more worth to thee than it.  37:18. The soul of a holy man discovereth sometimes true things, more than seven watchmen that sit in a high place to watch.  37:19. But above all these things pray to the most High, that he may direct thy way in truth.  37:20. In all thy works let the true word go before thee, and steady counsel before every action.  37:21. A wicked word shall change the heart: out of which four manner of things arise, good and evil, life and death: and the tongue is continually the ruler of them. There is a man that is subtle and a teacher of many, and yet is unprofitable to his own soul.  37:22. A skilful man hath taught many, and is sweet to his own soul.  37:23. He that speaketh sophistically, is hateful: he shall be destitute of every thing.  37:24. Grace is not given him from the Lord: for he is deprived of all wisdom.  37:25. There is a wise man that is wise to his own soul: and the fruit of his understanding is commendable.  37:26. A wise man instructeth his own people, and the fruits of his understanding are faithful.  37:27. A wise man shall be filled with blessings, and they that see shall praise him.  37:28. The life of a man is in the number of his days: but the days of Israel are innumerable.  37:29. A wise man shall inherit honour among his people, and his name shall live for ever.  37:30. My son, prove thy soul in thy life: and if it be wicked, give it no power:  37:31. For all things are not expedient for all, and every kind pleaseth not every soul.  37:32. Be not greedy in any feasting, and pour not out thyself upon any meat:  37:33. For in many meats there will be sickness, and greediness will turn to choler.  37:34.

The most High hath created medicines out of the earth, and a wise man will not abhor them.  38:5. Was not bitter water made sweet with wood?  38:6. The virtue of these things is come to the knowledge of men, and the most High hath given knowledge to men, that he may be honoured in his wonders.  38:7. By these he shall cure and shall allay their pains, and of these the apothecary shall make sweet confections, and shall make up ointments of health, and of his works there shall be no end.  38:8.

Turn away from sin and order thy hands aright, and cleanse thy heart from all offence.  38:11. Give a sweet savour, and a memorial of fine flour, and make a fat offering, and then give place to the physician.  38:12.

And they shall beseech the Lord, that he would prosper what they give for ease and remedy, for their conversation.  38:15.

And for fear of being ill spoken of weep bitterly for a day, and then comfort thyself in thy sadness.  38:18. And make mourning for him according to his merit for a day, or two, for fear of detraction.  38:19. For of sadness cometh death, and it overwhelmeth the strength, and the sorrow of the heart boweth down the neck.  38:20. In withdrawing aside sorrow remaineth: and the substance of the poor is according to his heart.  38:21. Give not up thy heart to sadness, but drive it from thee: and remember the latter end.  38:22. Forget it not: for there is no returning, and thou shalt do him no good, and shalt hurt thyself.  38:23. Remember my judgment: for thine also shall be so: yesterday for me, and to day for thee.  38:24. When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest, and comfort him in the departing of his spirit.  38:25. The wisdom of a scribe cometh by his time of leisure: and he that is less in action, shall receive wisdom.  A scribe... That is, a doctor of the law, or, a learned man.  38:26.  With what wisdom shall he be furnished that holdeth the plough, and that glorieth in the goad, that driveth the oxen therewith, and is occupied in their labours, and his whole talk is about the offspring of bulls?  38:27. He shall give his mind to turn up furrows, and his care is to give the kine fodder.  38:28. So every craftsman and workmaster that laboureth night and day, he who maketh graven seals, and by his continual diligence varieth the figure: he shall give his mind to the resemblance of the picture, and by his watching shall finish the work.  38:29. So doth the smith sitting by the anvil and considering the iron work. The vapour of the fire wasteth his flesh, and he fighteth with the heat of the furnace.  38:30. The noise of the hammer is always in his ears, and his eye is upon the pattern of the vessel he maketh.  38:31. He setteth his mind to finish his work, and his watching to polish them to perfection.  38:32. So doth the potter sitting at his work, turning the wheel about with his feet, who is always carefully set to his work, and maketh all his work by number:  38:33.

Good things were created for the good from the beginning, so for the wicked, good and evil things.  39:31. The principal things necessary for the life of men, are water, fire, and iron, salt, milk, and bread of flour, and honey, and the cluster of the grape, and oil, and clothing.  39:32. All these things shall be for good to the holy, so to the sinners and the ungodly they shall be turned into evil.  39:33. There are spirits that are created for vengeance, and in their fury they lay on grievous torments.  39:34.

Thy eye desireth favour and beauty, but more than these green sown fields.  40:23. A friend and companion meeting together in season, but above them both is a wife with her husband.  40:24. Brethren are a help in the time of trouble, but mercy shall deliver more than they.  40:25. Gold and silver make the feet stand sure: but wise counsel is above them both.  40:26. Riches and strength lift up the heart: but above these is the fear of the Lord.  40:27. There is no want in the fear of the Lord, and it needeth not to seek for help.  40:28. The fear of the Lord is like a paradise of blessing, and they have covered it above all glory.  40:29. My son, in thy lifetime be not indigent: for it is better to die than to want.  40:30. The life of him that looketh toward another man's table is not to be counted a life: for he feedeth his soul with another man's meat.  40:31. But a man, well instructed and taught, will look to himself.  40:32. Begging will be sweet in the mouth of the unwise, but in his belly there shall burn a fire.  \n",

      "things we ought to be ashamed.  41:1. O death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that hath peace in his possessions!  41:2. To a man that is at rest, and whose ways are prosperous in all things, and that is yet able to take meat!  41:3. O death thy sentence is welcome to the man that is in need, and to him whose strength faileth:  41:4. Who is in a decrepit age, and that is in care about all things, and to the distrustful that loseth patience!  41:5. Fear not the sentence of death. Remember what things have been before thee, and what shall come after thee: this sentence is from the Lord upon all flesh.  41:6. And what shall come upon thee by the good pleasure of the most High? whether ten, or a hundred, or a thousand years.  41:7. For among the dead there is no accusing of life.  41:8. The children of sinners become children of abominations, and they that converse near the houses of the ungodly.  41:9. The inheritance of the children of sinners shall perish, and with their posterity shall be a perpetual reproach.  41:10. The children will complain of an ungodly father, because for his sake they are in reproach.  41:11. Woe to you, ungodly men, who have forsaken the law of the most high Lord.  41:12. And if you be born, you shall be born in malediction: and if you die, in malediction shall be your portion.  41:13. All things that are of the earth, shall return into the earth: so the ungodly shall from malediction to destruction.  41:14. The mourning of men is about their body, but the name of the ungodly shall be blotted out.  41:15. Take care of a good name: for this shall continue with thee, more than a thousand treasures precious and great.  41:16. A good life hath its number of days: but a good name shall continue for ever.  41:17. My children, keep discipline in peace: for wisdom that is hid, and a treasure that is not seen, what profit is there in them both?  41:18. Better is the man that hideth his folly, than the man that hideth his wisdom.  41:19. Wherefore have a shame of these things I am now going to speak of.  Have a shame, etc... That is to say, be ashamed of doing any of these things, which I am now going to mention; for though sometimes shamefacedness is not to be indulged: yet it is often good and necessary: as in the following cases.  41:20. For it is not good to keep all shamefacedness: and all things do not please all men in opinion.  41:21. Be ashamed of fornication before father and mother: and of a lie before a governor and a man in power:  41:22. Of an offence before a prince, and a judge: of iniquity before a congregation and a people:  41:23. Of injustice before a companion and friend: and in regard to the place where thou dwellest,  41:24. Of theft, and of the truth of God, and the covenant: of leaning with thy elbow over meat, and of deceit in giving and taking:  41:25. Of silence before them that salute thee: of looking upon a harlot: and of turning away thy face from thy kinsman.  41:26. Turn not away thy face from thy neighbour, and of taking away a portion and not restoring.  41:27. Gaze not upon another man's wife, and be not inquisitive after his handmaid, and approach not her bed.  41:28. Be ashamed of upbraiding speeches before friends: and after thou hast given, upbraid not.  \n",

Repeat not the word which thou hast heard, and disclose not the thing that is secret; so shalt thou be truly without confusion, and shalt find favour before all men: be not ashamed of any of these things, and accept no person to sin thereby:  42:2. Of the law of the most High, and of his covenant, and of judgment to justify the ungodly:  42:3. Of the affair of companions and travellers, and of the gift of the inheritance of friends:  42:4. Of exactness of balance and weights, of getting much or little:  42:5. Of the corruption of buying, and of merchants, and of much correction of children, and to make the side of a wicked slave to bleed.  42:6. Sure keeping is good over a wicked wife.  42:7. Where there are many hands, shut up, and deliver all things in number, and weight: and put all in writing that thou givest out or receivest in.  42:8. Be not ashamed to inform the unwise and foolish, and the aged, that are judged by young men: and thou shalt be well instructed in all things, and well approved in the sight of all men living.  42:9. The father waketh for the daughter when no man knoweth, and the care for her taketh away his sleep, when she is young, lest she pass away the flower of her age, and when she is married, lest she should be hateful:  42:10. In her virginity, lest she should be corrupted, and be found with child in her father's house: and having a husband, lest she should misbehave herself, or at the least become barren.  42:11. Keep a sure watch over a shameless daughter: lest at anytime she make thee become a laughingstock to thy enemies, and a byword in the city, and a reproach among the people, and she make thee ashamed before all the multitude.  42:12. Behold not everybody's beauty: and tarry not among women.  42:13. For from garments cometh a moth, and from a woman the iniquity of a man.  42:14. For better is the iniquity of a man, than a woman doing a good turn, and a woman bringing shame and reproach.  Better is the iniquity, etc... That is, there is, commonly speaking, less danger to be apprehended to the soul from the churlishness, or injuries we receive from men, than from the flattering favours and familiarity of women.  42:15. I will now remember the works of the Lord, and I will declare the things I have seen. By the words of the Lord are his works.  42:16. The sun giving light hath looked upon all things, and full of the glory of the Lord is his work.  42:17. Hath not the Lord made the saints to declare all his wonderful works, which the Lord Almighty hath firmly settled to be established for his glory?  42:18. He hath searched out the deep, and the heart of men: and considered their crafty devices.  42:19. For the Lord knoweth all knowledge, and hath beheld the signs of the world, he declareth the things that are past, and the things that are to come, and revealeth the traces of hidden things.  42:20. No thought escapeth him, and no word can hide itself from him.  42:21. He hath beautified the glorious works of his wisdom: and he is from eternity to eternity, and to him nothing may be added,  42:22. Nor can he be diminished, and he hath no need of any counsellor.  42:23. O how desirable are all his works, and what we can know is but as a spark!  42:24. All these things live, and remain for ever, and for every use all things obey him.  42:25. All things are double, one against another, and he hath made nothing defective.  42:26.

As one keeping a furnace in the works of heat:  43:4. The sun three times as much, burneth the mountains, breathing out fiery vapours, and shining with his beams, he blindeth the eyes.  43:5. Great is the Lord that made him, and at his words he hath hastened his course.  43:6. And the moon in all in her season, is for a declaration of times and a sign of the world.  43:7. From the moon is the sign of the festival day, a light that decreaseth in her perfection.  43:8. The month is called after her name, increasing wonderfully in her perfection.  43:9.

It encompasseth the heaven about with the circle of its glory, the hands of the most High have displayed it.  43:14. By his commandment he maketh the snow to fall apace, and sendeth forth swiftly the lightnings of his judgment.  43:15. Through this are the treasures opened, and the clouds fly out like birds.  43:16. By his greatness he hath fixed the clouds, and the hailstones are broken.  43:17. At his sight shall the mountains be shaken, and at his will the south wind shall blow.  43:18. The noise of his thunder shall strike the earth, so doth the northern storm, and the whirlwind:  43:19. And as the birds lighting upon the earth, he scattereth snow, and the falling thereof, is as the coming down of locusts.  43:20. The eye admireth at the beauty of the whiteness thereof, and the heart is astonished at the shower thereof.  43:21. He shall pour frost as salt upon the earth: and when it freezeth, it shall become like the tops of thistles.  43:22. The cold north wind bloweth, and the water is congealed into crystal; upon every gathering together of waters it shall rest, and shall clothe the waters as a breastplate.  43:23. And it shall devour the mountains, and burn the wilderness, and consume all that is green as with fire.  43:24. A present remedy of all is the speedy coming of a cloud, and a dew that meeteth it, by the heat that cometh, shall overpower it.  43:25. At his word the wind is still, and with his thought he appeaseth the deep, and the Lord hath planted islands therein.  43:26.

And ruling over the present people, and by the strength of wisdom instructing the people in most holy words.  44:5.

All these have gained glory in their generations, and were praised in their days.  44:8. They that were born of them have left a name behind them, that their praises might be related:  44:9. And there are some, of whom there is no memorial: who are perished, as if they had never been: and are become as if they had never been born, and their children with them.  44:10. But these were men of mercy, whose godly deeds have not failed:  44:11. Good things continue with their seed,  44:12. Their posterity are a holy inheritance, and their seed hath stood in the covenants.  44:13. And their children for their sakes remain for ever: their seed and their glory shall not be forsaken.  44:14.

He exalted Aaron his brother, and like to himself of the tribe of Levi:  45:8.

And he girded him about with a glorious girdle, and clothed him with a robe of glory, and crowned him with majestic attire.  45:10.

This was made to him for an everlasting testament, and to his seed as the days of heaven, to execute the office of the priesthood, and to have praise, and to glorify his people in his name.  45:20.

And they two being appointed, were delivered out of the danger from among the number of six hundred thousand men on foot, to bring them into their inheritance, into the land that floweth with milk and honey.  46:11.

In lifting up his hand, with the stone in the sling he beat down the boasting of Goliath:  47:6.

For he destroyed the enemies on every side, and extirpated the Philistines the adversaries unto this day: he broke their horn for ever.  47:9.

Thou hast stained thy glory, and defiled thy seed so as to bring wrath upon thy children, and to have thy folly kindled,  47:23.

But God will not leave off his mercy, and he will not destroy, nor abolish his own works, neither will he cut up by the roots the offspring of his elect: and he will not utterly take away the seed of him that loveth the Lord.  47:25. Wherefore he gave a remnant to Jacob, and to David of the same stock.  47:26. And Solomon had an end with his fathers.  47:27. And he left behind him of his seed, the folly of the nation,  47:28.

Who raisedst up a dead man from below, from the lot of death, by the word of the Lord God.  48:6. Who broughtest down kings to destruction, and brokest easily their power in pieces, and the glorious from their bed.  48:7. Who heardest judgment in Sina, and in Horeb the judgments of vengeance.  48:8. Who anointedst kings to penance, and madest prophets successors after thee.  48:9. Who wast taken up in a whirlwind of fire, in a chariot of fiery horses.  48:10. Who art registered in the judgments of times to appease the wrath of the Lord, to reconcile the heart of the father to the son, and to restore the tribes of Jacob.  48:11. Blessed are they that saw thee, and were honoured with thy friendship.  48:12. For we live only in our life, but after death our name shall not be such.  48:13. Elias was indeed covered with the whirlwind, and his spirit was filled up in Eliseus: in his days he feared not the prince, and no man was more powerful than he.  48:14. No word could overcome him, and after death his body prophesied.  48:15. In his life he did great wonders, and in death he wrought miracles.  48:16. For all this the people repented not, neither did they depart from their sins till they were cast out of their land, and were scattered through all the earth.  48:17. And there was left but a small people, and a prince in the house of David.  48:18. Some of these did that which pleased God: but others committed many sins.  48:19. Ezechias fortified his city, and brought in water into the midst thereof, and he digged a rock with iron, and made a well for water.  48:20. In his days Sennacherib came up, and sent Rabsaces, and lifted up his hand against them, and he stretched out his hand against Sion, and became proud through his power.  48:21. Then their hearts and hands trembled, and they were in pain as women in travail.  48:22. And they called upon the Lord who is merciful, and spreading their hands, they lifted them up to heaven: and the holy Lord God quickly heard their voice.  48:23. He was not mindful of their sins, neither did he deliver them up to their enemies, but he purified them by the hand of Isaias, the holy prophet.  48:24. He overthrew the army of the Assyrians, and the angel of the Lord destroyed them.  48:25. For Ezechias did that which pleased God, and walked valiantly in the way of David his father, which Isaias, the great prophet, and faithful in the sight of God, had commanded him.  48:26. In his days the sun wen backward, and he lengthened the king's life.  48:27. With a great spirit he saw the things that are to come to pass at last, and comforted the mourners in Sion.  48:28. He showed what should come to pass for ever, and secret things before they came.  \n",

The memory of Josias is like the composition of a sweet smell made by the art of a perfumer:  49:2. His remembrance shall be sweet as honey in every mouth, and as music at a banquet of wine.  49:3. He was directed by God unto the repentance of the nation, and he took away the abominations of wickedness.  49:4. And he directed his heart towards the Lord, and in the days of sinners he strengthened godliness.  49:5. Except David, and Ezechias and Josias, all committed sin.  49:6. For the kings of Juda forsook the law of the most High, and despised the fear of God.  49:7. So they gave their kingdom to others, and their glory to a strange nation,  49:8. They burnt the chosen city of holiness, and made the streets thereof desolate according to the prediction of Jeremias.  49:9. For they treated him evil, who was consecrated a prophet from his mother's womb, to overthrow, and pluck up, and destroy, and to build again, and renew.  49:10. It was Ezechiel that saw the glorious vision, which was shewn him upon the chariot of cherubims.  49:11. For he made mention of the enemies under the figure of rain, and of doing good to them that shewed right ways.  49:12. And may the bones of the twelve prophets spring up out of their place: for they strengthened Jacob, and redeemed themselves by strong faith.  49:13. How shall we magnify Zorobabel? for he was as a signet on the right hand;  49:14. In like manner Jesus the son of Josedec who in their days built the house, and set up a holy temple to the Lord, prepared for everlasting glory.  49:15. And let Nehemias be a long time remembered, who raised up for us our walls that were cast down, and set up the gates and the bars, who rebuilt our houses.  49:16. No man was born upon earth like Henoch: for he also was taken up from the earth.  49:17. Nor as Joseph, who was a man born prince of his brethren, the support of his family, the ruler of his brethren, the stay of the people:  49:18. And his bones were visited, and after death they prophesied.  They prophesied... That is, by their being carried out of Egypt they verified the prophetic prediction of Joseph. Gen. 50.  49:19.

      " 50:1. Simon the high priest, the son of Onias, who in his life propped up the house, and in his days fortified the temple.  50:2. By him also the height of the temple was founded, the double building and the high walls of the temple.  50:3. In his days the wells of water flowed out, and they were filled as the sea above measure.  50:4. He took care of his nation, and delivered it from destruction.  50:5. He prevailed to enlarge the city, and obtained glory in his conversation with the people: and enlarged the entrance of the house and the court.  50:6. He shone in his days as the morning star in the midst of a cloud, and as the moon at the full.  50:7. And as the sun when it shineth, so did he shine in the temple of God.  50:8. And as the rainbow giving light in bright clouds, and as the flower of roses in the days of the spring, and as the lilies that are on the brink of the water, and as the sweet smelling frankincense in the time of summer.  50:9. As a bright fire, and frankincense burning in the fire.  50:10. As a massy vessel of gold, adorned with every precious stone.  50:11. As an olive tree budding forth, and a cypress tree rearing itself on high, when he put on the robe of glory, and was clothed with the perfection of power.  Clothed with the perfection of power... That is, with all the vestments denoting his dignity and authority.  50:12. When he went up to the holy altar, he honoured the vesture of holiness.  50:13. And when he took the portions out of the hands of the priests, he himself stood by the altar. And about him was the ring of his brethren: and as the cedar planted in mount Libanus,  50:14. And as branches of palm trees, they stood round about him, and all the sons of Aaron in their glory.  50:15. And the oblation of the Lord was in their hands, before all the congregation of Israel: and finishing his service, on the altar, to honour the offering of the most high King,  50:16. He stretched forth his hand to make a libation, and offered of the blood of the grape.  50:17. He poured out at the foot of the altar a divine odour to the most high Prince.  50:18. Then the sons of Aaron shouted, they sounded with beaten trumpets, and made a great noise to be heard for a remembrance before God.  50:19. Then all the people together made haste, and fell down to the earth upon their faces, to adore the Lord their God, and to pray to the Almighty God the most High.  50:20. And the singers lifted up their voices, and in the great house the sound of sweet melody was increased.  50:21. And the people in prayer besought the Lord the most High, until the worship of the Lord was perfected, and they had finished their office.  50:22. Then coming down, he lifted up his hands over all the congregation of the children of Israel, to give glory to God with his lips, and to glory in his name:  50:23. And he repeated his prayer, willing to shew the power of God.  50:24. And now pray ye to the God of all, who hath done great things in all the earth, who hath increased our days from our mother's womb, and hath done with us according to his mercy.  50:25. May he grant us joyfulness of heart, and that there be peace in our days in Israel for ever:  50:26. That Israel may believe that the mercy of God is with us, to deliver us in his days.  50:27. There are two nations which my soul abhorreth: and the third is no nation: which I hate:  Abhorreth... Viz., with a holy indignation, as enemies of God and persecutors of his people. Such were then the Edomites who abode in mount Seir, the Philistines, and the Samaritans who dwelt in Sichem, and had their schismatical temple in that neighbourhood.  50:28. They that sit on mount Seir, and the Philistines, and the foolish people that dwell in Sichem.  50:29. Jesus the son of Sirach, of Jerusalem, hath written in this book the doctrine of wisdom and instruction, who renewed wisdom from his heart.  50:30. Blessed is he that is conversant in these good things and he that layeth them up in his heart, shall be wise always.  50:31. For if he do them, he shall be strong to do all things: because the light of God guideth his steps.  \n",

      " 51:1. A prayer of Jesus the son of Sirach. I will give glory to thee, O Lord, O King, and I will praise thee, O God my Saviour.  51:2. I will give glory to thy name: for thou hast been a helper and protector to me.  51:3. And hast preserved my body from destruction, from the snare of an unjust tongue, and from the lips of them that forge lies, and in the sight of them that stood by, thou hast been my helper.  51:4. And thou hast delivered me, according to the multitude of the mercy of thy name, from them that did roar, prepared to devour.  51:5. Out of the hands of them that sought my life, and from the gates of afflictions, which compassed me about:  51:6. From the oppression of the flame which surrounded me, and in the midst of the fire I was not burnt.  51:7. From the depth of the belly of hell, and from an unclean tongue, and from lying words, from an unjust king, and from a slanderous tongue:  51:8. My soul shall praise the Lord even to death.  51:9. And my life was drawing near to hell beneath.  51:10. They compassed me on every side, and there was no one that would help me. I looked for the succour of men, and there was none.  51:11. I remembered thy mercy, O Lord, and thy works, which are from the beginning of the world.  51:12. How thou deliverest them that wait for thee, O Lord, and savest them out of the hands of the nations.  51:13. Thou hast exalted my dwelling place upon the earth and I have prayed for death to pass away.  51:14. I called upon the Lord, the father of my Lord, that he would not leave me in the day of my trouble, and in the time of the proud without help.  51:15. I will praise thy name continually, and will praise it with thanksgiving, and my prayer was heard.  51:16. And thou hast saved me from destruction, and hast delivered me from the evil time.  51:17. Therefore I will give thanks, and praise thee, and bless the name of the Lord.  51:18. When I was yet young, before I wandered about, I sought for wisdom openly in my prayer.  51:19. I prayed for her before the temple, and unto the very end I will seek after her, and she flourished as a grape soon ripe.  51:20. My heart delighted in her, my foot walked in the right way, from my youth up I sought after her.  51:21. I bowed down my ear a little, and received her.  51:22. I found much wisdom in myself, and profited much therein.  51:23. To him that giveth me wisdom, will I give glory.  51:24. For I have determined to follow her: I have had a zeal for good, and shall not be confounded.  51:25. My soul hath wrestled for her, and in doing it I have been confirmed.  51:26. I stretched forth my hands on high, and I bewailed my ignorance of her.  51:27. I directed my soul to her, and in knowledge I found her.  51:28. I possessed my heart with her from the beginning: therefore I shall not be forsaken.  51:29. My entrails were troubled in seeking her: therefore shall I possess a good possession.  51:30. The Lord hath given me a tongue for my reward: and with it I will praise him.  51:31. Draw near to me, ye unlearned, and gather yourselves together into the hours of discipline.  51:32. Why are ye slow and what do you say of these things? your souls are exceeding thirsty.  51:33. I have opened my mouth, and have spoken: buy her for yourselves without silver,  51:34. And submit your neck to the yoke, and let your soul receive discipline: for she is near at hand to be found.  51:35. Behold with your eyes how I have laboured a little, and have found much rest to myself.  51:36. Receive ye discipline as a great sum of money, and possess abundance of gold by her.  51:37. Let your soul rejoice in his mercy and you shall not be confounded in his praise.  51:38. Work your work before the time, and he will give you your reward in his time.   \n",

For he is found by them that tempt him not: and he sheweth himself to them that have faith in him.  1:3. For perverse thoughts separate from God: and his power, when it is tried, reproveth the unwise:  1:4. For wisdom will not enter into a malicious soul, nor dwell in a body subject to sins.  1:5. For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful, and will withdraw himself from thoughts that are without understanding, and he shall not abide when iniquity cometh in.  1:6. For the spirit of wisdom is benevolent, and will not acquit the evil speaker from his lips: for God is witness of his reins, and he is a true searcher of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.  1:7. For the Spirit of the Lord hath filled the whole world: and that which containeth all things, hath knowledge of the voice.  1:8. Therefore he that speaketh unjust things, cannot be hid, neither shall the chastising judgment pass him by.  1:9. For inquisition shall be made into the thoughts of the ungodly, and the hearing of his words shall come to God, to the chastising of his iniquities.  1:10. For the ear of jealousy heareth all things, and the tumult of murmuring shall not be hid.  1:11. Keep yourselves, therefore, from murmuring, which profiteth nothing, and refrain your tongue from detraction, for an obscure speech shall not go for nought: and the mouth that belieth, killeth the soul.  1:12. Seek not death in the error of your life, neither procure ye destruction by the works of your hands.  1:13. For God made not death, neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the living.  1:14. For he created all things that they might be: and he made the nations of the earth for health: and there is no poison of destruction in them, nor kingdom of hell upon the earth.  1:15. For justice is perpetual and immortal.  1:16.

For they have said, reasoning with themselves, but not right: The time of our life is short and tedious, and in the end of a man there is no remedy, and no man hath been known to have returned from hell:  2:2. For we are born of nothing, and after this we shall be as if we had not been: for the breath in our nostrils is smoke: and speech a spark to move our heart,  2:3. Which being put out, our body shall be ashes, and our spirit shall be poured abroad as soft air, and our life shall pass away as the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, which is driven away by the beams of the sun, and overpowered with the heat thereof:  2:4. And our name in time shall be forgotten, and no man shall have any remembrance of our works.  2:5. For our time is as the passing of a shadow, and there is no going back of our end: for it is fast sealed, and no man returneth:  2:6. Come, therefore, and let us enjoy the good things that are present, and let us speedily use the creatures as in youth.  2:7. Let us fill ourselves with costly wine, and ointments: and let not the flower of the time pass by us.  2:8. Let us crown ourselves with roses, before they be withered: let no meadow escape our riot.  2:9. Let none of us go without his part in luxury: let us every where leave tokens of joy: for this is our portion, and this our lot.  2:10. Let us oppress the poor just man, and not spare the widow, nor honour the ancient grey hairs of the aged.  2:11. But let our strength be the law of justice: for that which is feeble is found to be nothing worth.  2:12. Let us, therefore, lie in wait for the just, because he is not for our turn, and he is contrary to our doings, and upbraideth us with transgressions of the law, and divulgeth against us the sins of our way of life.  2:13. He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the son of God.  2:14. He is become a censurer of our thoughts.  2:15. He is grievous unto us, even to behold: for his life is not like other men's, and his ways are very different.  2:16. We are esteemed by him as triflers, and he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness, and he preferreth the latter end of the just, and glorieth that he hath God for his father.  2:17. Let us see then if his words be true, and let us prove what shall happen to him, and we shall know what his end shall be.  2:18. For if he be the true son of God, he will defend him, and will deliver him from the hands of his enemies.  2:19. Let us examine him by outrages and tortures, that we may know his meekness, and try his patience.  2:20. Let us condemn him to a most shameful death: for there shall be respect had unto him by his words.  2:21. These things they thought, and were deceived: for their own malice blinded them.  2:22. And they knew not the secrets of God, nor hoped for the wages of justice, nor esteemed the honour of holy souls.  2:23.

Afflicted in few things, in many they shall be well rewarded: because God hath tried them, and found them worthy of himself.  3:6.

      " 7:1. I myself am a mortal man, like all others, and of the race of him, that was first made of the earth, and in the womb of my mother I was fashioned to be flesh.  7:2. In the time of ten months I was compacted in blood, of the seed of man, and the pleasure of sleep concurring.  7:3. And being born, I drew in the common air, and fell upon the earth, that is made alike, and the first voice which I uttered was crying, as all others do.  7:4. I was nursed in swaddling clothes, and with great cares.  7:5. For none of the kings had any other beginning of birth.  7:6. For all men have one entrance into life, and the like going out.  7:7. Wherefore I wished, and understanding was given me: and I called upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came upon me:  7:8. And I preferred her before kingdoms and thrones, and esteemed riches nothing in comparison of her.  7:9. Neither did I compare unto her any precious stone: for all gold, in comparison of her, is as a little sand; and silver, in respect to her, shall be counted as clay.  7:10. I loved her above health and beauty, and chose to have her instead of light: for her light cannot be put out.  7:11. Now all good things came to me together with her, and innumerable riches through her hands,  7:12. And I rejoiced in all these: for this wisdom went before me, and I knew not that she was the mother of them all.  7:13. Which I have learned without guile, and communicate without envy, and her riches I hide not.  7:14. For she is an infinite treasure to men: which they that use, become the friends of God, being commended for the gifts of discipline.  7:15. And God hath given to me to speak as I would, and to conceive thoughts worthy of those things that are given me: because he is the guide of wisdom, and the director of the wise:  7:16. For in his hand are both we, and our words, and all wisdom, and the knowledge and skill of works.  7:17. For he hath given me the true knowledge of the things that are: to know the disposition of the whole world, and the virtues of the elements,  7:18. The beginning, and ending, and midst of the times, the alterations of their courses, and the changes of seasons,  7:19. The revolutions of the year, and the dispositions of the stars,  7:20. The natures of living creatures, and rage of wild beasts, the force of winds, and reasonings of men, the diversities of plants, and the virtues of roots,  7:21. And all such things as are hid, and not foreseen, I have learned: for wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me.  7:22. For in her is the spirit of understanding; holy, one, manifold, subtile, eloquent, active, undefiled, sure, sweet, loving that which is good, quick, which nothing hindereth, beneficent,  7:23. Gentle, kind, steadfast, assured, secure, having all power, overseeing all things, and containing all spirits: intelligible, pure, subtile:  7:24. For wisdom is more active than all active things; and reacheth everywhere, by reason of her purity.  7:25. For she is a vapour of the power of God, and a certain pure emmanation of the glory of the Almighty God: and therefore no defiled thing cometh into her.  7:26. For she is the brightness of eternal light, and the unspotted mirror of God's majesty, and the image of his goodness.  7:27. And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself the same, she reneweth all things, and through nations conveyeth herself into holy souls, she maketh the friends of God and prophets.  7:28. For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom.  7:29. For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of the stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it.  7:30. For after this cometh night, but no evil can overcome wisdom.  \n",

      " 8:1. She reacheth, therefore, from end to end mightily, and ordereth all things sweetly.  8:2. Her have I loved, and have sought her out from my youth, and have desired to take for my spouse, and I became a lover of her beauty.  8:3. She glorifieth her nobility by being conversant with God: yea, and the Lord of all things hath loved her.  8:4. For it is she that teacheth the knowledge of God and is the chooser of his works.  8:5. And if riches be desired in life, what is richer than wisdom, which maketh all things?  8:6. And if sense do work: who is a more artful worker than she of those things that are?  8:7. And if a man love justice: her labours have great virtues: for she teacheth temperance, and prudence, and justice, and fortitude, which are such things as men can have nothing more profitable in life.  8:8. And if a man desire much knowledge: she knoweth things past, and judgeth of things to come: she knoweth the subtilties of speeches, and the solutions of arguments: she knoweth signs and wonders before they be done, and the events of times and ages.  8:9. I purposed, therefore, to take her to me to live with me: knowing that she will communicate to me of her good things, and will be a comfort in my cares and grief.  8:10. For her sake I shall have glory among the multitude, and honour with the ancients, though I be young:  8:11. And I shall be found of a quick conceit in judgment, and shall be admired in the sight of the mighty, and the faces of princes shall wonder at me.  8:12. They shall wait for me when I hold my peace, and they shall look upon me when I speak; and if I talk much, they shall lay their hands on their mouth.  8:13. Moreover, by the means of her I shall have immortality: and shall leave behind me an everlasting memory to them that come after me.  8:14. I shall set the people in order: and nations shall be subject to me.  8:15. Terrible kings hearing, shall be afraid of me: among the multitude I shall be found good, and valiant in war.  8:16. When I go into my house, I shall repose myself with her: for her conversation hath no bitterness, nor her company any tediousness, but joy and gladness.  8:17. Thinking these things with myself, and pondering them in my heart, that to be allied to wisdom is immortality,  8:18. And that there is great delight in her friendship, and inexhaustible riches in the works of her hands, and in the exercise of conference with her, wisdom, and glory in the communication of her words: I went about seeking, that I might take her to myself.  8:19. And I was a witty child, and had received a good soul.  8:20. And whereas I was more good, I came to a body undefiled.  8:21. And as I knew that I could not otherwise be continent, except God gave it, and this also was a point of wisdom, to know whose gift it was, I went to the Lord, and besought him, and said with my whole heart:  \n",

And by thy wisdom hast appointed man, that he should have dominion over the creature that was made by thee,  9:3. That he should order the world according to equity and justice, and execute justice with an upright heart:  9:4. Give me wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne, and cast me not off from among thy children:  9:5. For I am thy servant, and the son of thy handmaid, a weak man, and of short time, and falling short of the understanding of judgment and laws.  9:6. For if one be perfect among the children of men, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded.  9:7. Thou hast chosen me to be king of thy people, and a judge of thy sons and daughters:  9:8. And hast commanded me to build a temple on thy holy mount, and an altar in the city of thy dwelling place, a resemblance of thy holy tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from the beginning:  9:9. And thy wisdom with thee, which knoweth thy works, which then also was present when thou madest the world, and knew what was agreeable to thy eyes, and what was right in thy commandments.  9:10. Send her out of thy holy heaven, and from the throne of thy majesty, that she may be with me, and may labour with me, that I may know what is acceptable with thee:  9:11. For she knoweth and understandeth all things, and shall lead me soberly in my works, and shall preserve me by her power.  9:12. So shall my works be acceptable, and I shall govern thy people justly, and shall be worthy of the throne of my father.  9:13. For who among men is he that can know the counsel of God? or who can think what the will of God is?  9:14. For the thoughts of mortal men are fearful, and our counsels uncertain.  9:15. For the corruptible body is a load upon the soul, and the earthly habitation presseth down the mind that museth upon many things.  9:16. And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth: and with labour do we find the things that are before us. But the things that are in heaven, who shall search out?  9:17. And who shall know thy thought, except thou give wisdom, and send thy holy Spirit from above:  9:18. And so the ways of them that are upon earth may be corrected, and men may learn the things that please thee?  9:19.

And she brought him out of his sin, and gave him power to govern all things.  10:3. But when the unjust went away from her in his anger, he perished by the fury wherewith he murdered his brother.  The unjust... Cain.  10:4. For whose cause, when water destroyed the earth, wisdom healed it again, directing the course of the just by contemptible wood.  For whose cause... Viz., for the wickedness of the race of Cain.-Ibid. The just... Noe.  10:5. Moreover, when the nations had conspired together to consent to wickedness, she knew the just, and preserved him without blame to God, and kept him strong against the compassion for his son.  She knew the just... She found out and approved Abraham. Ibid. And kept him strong, etc... Gave him strength to stand firm against the efforts of his natural tenderness, when he was ordered to sacrifice his son.  10:6. She delivered the just man, who fled from the wicked that were perishing, when the fire came down upon Pentapolis:  The just man... Lot.-Ibid. Pentapolis... The land of the five cities, Sodom, Gomorrha, etc.  10:7. Whose land, for a testimony of their wickedness, is desolate, and smoketh to this day, and the trees bear fruits that ripen not, and a standing pillar of salt is a monument of an incredulous soul.  10:8. For regarding not wisdom, they did not only slip in this, that they were ignorant of good things; but they left also unto men a memorial of their folly, so that in the things in which they sinned, they could not so much as lie hid.  10:9. But wisdom hath delivered from sorrow them that attend upon her.  10:10. She conducted the just, when he fled from his brother's wrath, through the right ways, and shewed him the kingdom of God, and gave him the knowledge of the holy things, made him honourable in his labours, and accomplished his labours.  The just... Jacob.  10:11. In the deceit of them that overreached him, she stood by him, and made him honourable.  10:12. She kept him safe from his enemies, and she defended him from seducers, and gave him a strong conflict, that he might overcome, and know that wisdom is mightier than all.  Conflict... Viz., with the angel.  10:13. She forsook not the just when he was sold, but delivered him from sinners: she went down with him into the pit.  The just when he was sold... Viz., Joseph.  10:14. And in bands she left him not, till she brought him the sceptre of the kingdom, and power against those that oppressed him: and shewed them to be liars that had accused him, and gave him everlasting glory.  10:15. She delivered the just people, and blameless seed, from the nations that oppressed them.  10:16. She entered into the soul of the servant of God and stood against dreadful kings in wonders and signs.  The servant of God... Viz., Moses.  10:17. And she rendered to the just the wages of their labours, and conducted them in a wonderful way: and she was to them for a covert by day, and for the light of stars by night:  10:18. And she brought them through the Red Sea, and carried them over through a great water.  10:19. But their enemies she drowned in the sea, and from the depth of hell she brought them out. Therefore the just took the spoils of the wicked.  10:20. And they sung to thy holy name, O Lord, and they praised with one accord thy victorious hand.  10:21.

They went through wildernesses that were not inhabited, and in desert places they pitched their tents.  11:3. They stood against their enemies, and revenged themselves of their adversaries.  Their enemies... The Amalecites.  11:4. They were thirsty, and they called upon thee, and water was given them out of the high rock, and a refreshment of their thirst out of the hard stone.  11:5. For by what things their enemies were punished, when their drink failed them, while the children of Israel abounded therewith, and rejoiced:  By what things, etc... The meaning is, that God, who wrought a miracle to punish the Egyptians by thirst, when he turned all their waters into blood, (at which time the Israelites, who were exempt from those plagues, had plenty of water,) wrought another miracle in favour of his own people in their thirst, by giving them water out of the rock.  11:6. By the same things they in their need were benefited.  11:7. For instead of a fountain of an ever running river, thou gavest human blood to the unjust.  11:8. And whilst they were diminished for a manifest reproof of their murdering the infants, thou gavest to thine abundant water unlooked for:  11:9. Shewing by the thirst that was then, how thou didst exalt thine, and didst kill their adversaries.  11:10. For when they were tried, and chastised with mercy, they knew how the wicked were judged with wrath, and tormented.  11:11. For thou didst admonish and try them as a father: but the others, as a severe king, thou didst examine and condemn.  11:12. For whether absent or present, they were tormented alike.  11:13. For a double affliction came upon them, and a groaning for the remembrance of things past.  11:14. For when they heard that by their punishments the others were benefited, they remembered the Lord, wondering at the end of what was come to pass.  By their punishments, etc... That is, that the Israelites had been benefited and miraculously favoured in the same kind, in which they had been punished.  11:15. For whom they scorned before, when he was thrown out at the time of his being wickedly exposed to perish, him they admired in the end, when they saw the event: their thirsting being unlike to that of the just.  11:16. But for the foolish devices of their iniqnity, because some being deceived worshipped dumb serpents and worthless beasts, thou didst send upon them a multitude of dumb beasts for vengeance:  Dumb beasts... Viz., frogs, sciniphs, flies, and locusts.  11:17. That they might know that by what things a man sinneth, by the same also he is tormented.  11:18. For thy almighty hand, which made the world of matter without form, was not unable to send upon them a multitude of bears, or fierce lions,  11:19. Or unknown beasts of a new kind, full of rage; either breathing out a fiery vapour, or sending forth a stinking smoke, or shooting horrible sparks out of their eyes:  11:20. Whereof not only the hurt might be able to destroy them, but also the very sight might kill them through fear.  11:21. Yea, and without these, they might have been slain with one blast, persecuted by their own deeds, and scattered by the breath of thy power: but thou hast ordered all things in measure, and number, and weight.  11:22. For great power always belonged to thee alone: and who shall resist the strength of thy arm?  11:23. For the whole world before thee is as the least grain of the balance, and as a drop of the morning dew, that falleth down upon tho earth.  11:24. But thou hast mercy upon all, because thou canst do all things, and overlookest the sins of men for the sake of repentance.  11:25. For thou lovest all things that are, and hatest none of the things which thou hast made: for thou didst not appoint, or make any thing hating it.  11:26. And how could any thing endure, if thou wouldst not? or be preserved, if not called by thee?  11:27. But thou sparest all: because they are thine, O Lord, who lovest souls.  \n",

And therefore thou chastisest them that err, by little and little: and admonishest them, and speakest to them, concerning the things wherein they offend: that leaving their wickedness, they may believe in thee, O Lord.  12:3. For those ancient inhabitants of thy holy land, whom thou didst abhor,  12:4. Because they did works hateful to thee by their sorceries, and wicked sacrifices,  12:5. And those merciless murderers of their own children, and eaters of men's bowels, and devourers of blood from the midst of thy consecration,  From the midst of thy consecration... Literally, sacrament. That is, the land sacred to thee, in which thy temple was to be established, and man's redemption to be wrought.  12:6. And those parents sacrificing with their own hands helpless souls, it was thy will to destroy by the hands of our parents,  12:7. That the land which of all is most dear to thee, might receive a worthy colony of the children of God.  12:8. Yet even those thou sparedst as men, and didst send wasps forerunners of thy host, to destroy them by little and little.  12:9. Not that thou wast unable to bring the wicked under the just by war, or by cruel beasts, or with one rough word to destroy them at once:  12:10. But executing thy judgments by degrees, thou gavest them place of repentance, not being ignorant that they were a wicked generation, and their malice natural, and that their thought could never be changed.  12:11. For it was a cursed seed from the beginning: neither didst thou for fear of any one give pardon to their sins.  12:12. For who shall say to thee: What hast thou done?  or who shall withstand thy judgment? or who shall come before thee to be a revenger of wicked men? or who shall accuse thee, if the nations perish, which thou hast made?  12:13. For there is no other God but thou, who hast care of all, that thou shouldst shew that thou dost not give judgment unjustly.  12:14. Neither shall king, nor tyrant, in thy sight inquire about them whom thou hast destroyed.  12:15. For so much then, as thou art just, thou orderest all things justly: thinking it not agreeable to the power, to condemn him who deserveth not to be punished.  12:16. For thy power is the beginning of justice: and because thou art Lord of all, thou makest thyself gracious to all.  12:17. For thou shewest thy power, when men will not believe thee to be absolute in power, and thou convincest the boldness of them that know thee not.  12:18. But thou being master of power, judgest with tranquillity, and with great favour disposest of us: for thy power is at hand when thou wilt.  12:19. But thou hast taught thy people by such works, that they must be just and humane, and hast made thy children to be of a good hope: because in judging, thou givest place for repentance for sins.  12:20. For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy servants, and that deserved to die, with so great deliberation, giving them time and place whereby they might be changed from their wickedness:  12:21. With what circumspection hast thou judged thy own children, to whose parents thou hast sworn, and made covenants of good promises?  12:22. Therefore whereas thou chastisest us, thou scourgest our enemies very many ways, to the end that when we judge we may think on thy goodness: and when we are judged, we may hope for thy mercy.  12:23. Wherefore thou hast also greatly tormented them, who, in their life, have lived foolishly and unjustly, by the same things which they worshipped.  12:24. For they went astray for a long time in the ways of error, holding those things for gods which are the most worthless among beasts, living after the manner of children without understanding.  12:25. Therefore thou hast sent a judgment upon them, as senseless children, to mock them.  12:26. But they that were not amended by mockeries and reprehensions, experienced the worthy judgment of God.  12:27. For seeing, with indignation, that they suffered by those very things which they took for gods, when they were destroyed by the same, they acknowledged him the true God, whom in time past they denied that they knew: for which cause the end also of their condemnation came upon them.  \n",

But all men are vain, in whom there is not the knowledge of God: and who by these good things that are seen, could not understand him that is, neither by attending to the works have acknowledged who was the workman:  13:2. But have imagined either the fire, or the wind, or the swift air, or the circle of the stars, or the great water, or the sun and moon, to be the gods that rule the world.  13:3. With whose beauty, if they, being delighted, took them to be gods: let them know how much the Lord of them is more beautiful than they: for the first author of beauty made all those things.  13:4. Or if they admired their power, and their effects, let them understand by them, that he that made them, is mightier than they:  13:5. For by the greatness of the beauty, and of the creature, the creator of them may be seen, so as to be known thereby.  13:6. But yet as to these they are less to be blamed.  For they perhaps err, seeking God, and desirous to find him.  13:7. For being conversant among his works, they search: and they are persuaded that the things are good which are seen.  13:8. But then again they are not to be pardoned.  13:9. For if they were able to know so much as to make a judgment of the world: how did they not more easily find out the Lord thereof?  13:10. But unhappy are they, and their hope is among the dead, who have called gods the works of the hand of men, gold and silver, the inventions of art, and the resemblances of beasts, or an unprofitable stone the work of an ancient hand.  13:11. Or if an artist, a carpenter, hath cut down a tree proper for his use in the wood, and skilfully taken off all the bark thereof, and with his art, diligently formeth a vessel profitable for the common uses of life,  13:12. And useth the chips of his work to dress his meat:  13:13. And taking what was left thereof, which is good for nothing, being a crooked piece of wood, and full of knots, carveth it diligently when he hath nothing else to do, and by the skill of his art fashioneth it, and maketh it like the image of a man:  13:14. Or the resemblance of some beast, laying it over with vermilion, and painting it red, and covering every spot that is in it:  13:15. And maketh a convenient dwelling place for it, and setting it in a wall, and fastening it with iron,  13:16. Providing for it, lest it should fall, knowing that it is unable to help itself: for it is an image, and hath need of help.  13:17. And then maketh prayer to it, enquiring concerning his substance, and his children, or his marriage.  And he is not ashamed to speak to that which hath no life:  13:18. And for health he maketh supplication to the weak, and for life prayeth to that which is dead, and for help calleth upon that which is unprofitable:  13:19. And for a good journey he petitioneth him that cannot walk: and for getting, and for working, and for the event of all things he asketh him that is unable to do any thing.  \n",

For this the desire of gain devised, and the workman built it by his skill.  14:3. But thy providence, O Father, governeth it: for thou hast made a way even in the sea, and a most sure path among the waves,  14:4. Shewing that thou art able to save out of all things, yea, though a man went to sea without art.  14:5. But that the works of thy wisdom might not be idle: therefore men also trust their lives even to a little wood, and passing over the sea by ship, are saved.  14:6. And from the beginning also, when the proud giants perished, the hope of the world fleeing to a vessel, which was governed by thy hand, left to the world seed of generation.  14:7. For blessed is the wood, by which justice cometh  14:8. But the idol that is made by hands, is cursed, as well it, as he that made it: he because he made it; and it because being frail it is called a god.  14:9. But to God the wicked and his wickedness are hateful alike.  14:10. For that which is made, together with him that made it, shall suffer torments.  14:11. Therefore there shall be no respect had even to the idols of the Gentiles: because the creatures of God are turned to an abomination, and a temptation to the souls of men, and a snare to the feet of the unwise.   14:12. For the beginning of fornication is the devising of idols: and the invention of them is the corruption of life.  14:13. For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall they be for ever.  14:14. For by the vanity of men they came into the world: and therefore they shall be found to come shortly to an end.  14:15. For a father being afflicted with bitter grief, made to himself the image of his son, who was quickly taken away: and him who then had died as a man, he began now to worship as a god, and appointed him rites and sacrifices among his servants.  14:16. Then, in process of time, wicked custom prevailing, this error was kept as a law, and statues were worshipped by the commandment of tyrants.  14:17. And those whom men could not honour in presence, because they dwelt far off, they brought their resemblance from afar, and made an express image of the king, whom they had a mind to honour: that by this their diligence, they might honour as present, him that was absent.  14:18. And to the worshipping of these, the singular diligence also of the artificer helped to set forward the ignorant.  14:19. For he being willing to please him that employed him, laboured with all his art to make the resemblance in the best manner.  14:20. And the multitude of men, carried away by the beauty of the work, took him now for a god, that little before was but honoured as a man.  14:21. And this was the occasion of deceiving human life: for men serving either their affection, or their kings, gave the incommunicable name to stones and wood.  14:22. And it was not enough for them to err about the knowledge of God, but whereas they lived in a great war of ignorance, they call so many and so great evils peace.  14:23. For either they sacrifice their own children, or use hidden sacrifices, or keep watches full of madness,  14:24. So that now they neither keep life, nor marriage undefiled, but one killeth another through envy, or grieveth him by adultery:  14:25. And all things are mingled together, blood, murder, theft, and dissimulation, corruption and unfaithfulness, tumults and perjury, disquieting of the good,  14:26. Forgetfulness of God, defiling of souls, changing of nature, disorder in marriage, and the irregularity of adultery and uncleanness.  14:27. For the worship of abominable idols is the cause, and the beginning and end of all evil.  14:28. For either they are mad when they are merry: or they prophesy lies, or they live unjustly, or easily forswear themselves.  14:29. For whilst they trust in idols, which are without life, though they swear amiss, they look not to be hurt.  14:30. But for both these things they shall be justly punished, because they have thought not well of God, giving heed to idols, and have sworn unjustly, in guile despising justice.  14:31.

The potter also tempering soft earth, with labour fashioneth every vessel for our service, and of the same clay he maketh both vessels that are for clean uses, and likewise such as serve to the contrary: but what is the use of these vessels, the potter is the judge.  15:8. And of the same clay by a vain labour he maketh a god: he who a little before was made of earth himself, and a little after returneth to the same out of which he was taken, when his life, which was lent him, shall be called for again.  15:9. But his care is, not that he shall labour, nor that his life is short, but he striveth with the goldsmiths and silversmiths: and he endeavoureth to do like the workers in brass, and counteth it a glory to make vain things.  15:10. For his heart is ashes, and his hope vain earth and his life more base than clay:  15:11. Forasmuch as he knew not his maker, and him that inspired into him the soul that worketh, and that breathed into him a living spirit.  15:12. Yea, and they have counted our life a pastime and the business of life to be gain, and that we must be getting every way, even out of evil.  15:13. For that man knoweth that he offendeth above all others, who of earthly matter maketh brittle vessels, and graven gods.  15:14. But all the enemies of thy people that hold them in subjection, are foolish, and unhappy, and proud beyond measure:  15:15. For they have esteemed all the idols of the heathens for gods, which neither have the use of eyes to see, nor noses to draw breath, nor ears to hear, nor fingers of hands to handle, and as for their feet, they are slow to walk.  15:16. For man made them: and he that borroweth his own breath, fashioned them. For no man can make a god like to himself.  15:17. For being mortal himself, he formeth a dead thing with his wicked hands. For he is better than they whom he worshippeth, because he indeed hath lived, though he were mortal, but they never.  15:18. Moreover, they worship also the vilest creatures: but things without sense, compared to these, are worse than they.  15:19. Yea, neither by sight can any man see good of these beasts. But they have fled from the praise of God, and from his blessing.  Wisdom Chapter 16  \n",

      "worthily punished, and were destroyed by a multitude of beasts.  16:2. Instead of which punishment, dealiug well with thy people, thou gavest them their desire of delicious food, of a new taste, preparing for them quails for their meat:  16:3. To the end, that they indeed desiring food, by means of those things that were shewn and sent among them, might loath even that which was necessary to satisfy their desire. But these, after suffering want for a short time, tasted a new meat.  They indeed desiring food, etc... He means the Egyptians; who were restrained even from that food which was necessary, by the frogs and the flies that were sent amongst them, and spoiled all their meats.-Ibid. But these... Viz., the Israelites.  16:4. For it was requisite that inevitable destruction should come upon them that exercised tyranny: but to these it should only be shewn how their enemies were destroyed.  16:5. For when the fierce rage of beasts came upon these, they were destroyed by the bitings of crooked serpents.  16:6. But thy wrath endured not for ever, but they were troubled for a short time for their correction, having a sign of salvation, to put them in remembrance of the commandment of thy law.  Sign of salvation... The brazen serpent, an emblem of Christ our Saviour.  16:7. For he that turned to it, was not healed by that which he saw, but by thee, the Saviour of all.  16:8. And in this thou didst shew to our enemies, that thou art he who deliverest from all evil.  16:9. For the bitings of locusts, and of flies, killed them, and there was found no remedy for their life: because they were worthy to be destroyed by such things.  16:10. But not even the teeth of venomous serpents overcame thy children: for thy mercy came and healed them.  16:11. For they were examined for the remembrance of thy words, and were quickly healed, lest falling into deep forgetfulness, they might not be able to use thy help.  16:12. For it was neither herb, nor mollifying plaster, that healed them, but thy word, O Lord, which healeth all things.  16:13. For it is thou, O Lord, that hast power of life and death, and leadest down to the gates of death, and bringest back again:  16:14. A man indeed killeth through malice, and when the spirit is gone forth, it shall not return, neither shall he call back the soul that is received:  16:15. But it is impossible to escape thy hand:  16:16. For the wicked that denied to know thee, were scourged by the strength of thy arm, being persecuted by strange waters, and hail, and rain, and consumed by fire.  16:17. And which was wonderful, in water, which extinguisheth all things, the fire had more force: for the world fighteth for the just.  The fire had more force... Viz., when the fire and hail mingled together laid waste the land of Egypt. Ex. 9.  16:18. For at one time the fire was mitigated, that the beasts which were sent against the wicked might not be burnt, but that they might see, and perceive that they were persecuted by the judgment of God.  16:19. And at another time the fire, above its own power, burnt in the midst of water, to destroy the fruits of a wicked land.  16:20. Instead of which things, thou didst feed thy people with the food of angels, and gavest them bread from heaven, prepared without labour; having in it all that is delicious, and the sweetness of every taste.  16:21. For thy sustenance shewed thy sweetness to thy children, and serving every man's will, it was turned to what every man liked.  16:22. But snow and ice endured the force of fire, and melted not: that they might know that the fire, burning in the hail, and flashing in the rain, destroyed the fruits of the enemies.  16:23. But this same again, that the just might be nourished, did even forget its own strength.  16:24. For the creature serving thee, the Creator, is made fierce against the unjust for their punishment: and abateth its strength for the benefit of them that trust in thee.  16:25. Therefore even then it was transformed into all things, and was obedient to thy grace, that nourisheth all, according to the will of them that desired it of thee:  16:26. That thy children, O Lord, whom thou lovedst, might know that it is not the growing of fruits that nourisheth men, but thy word preserveth them that believe in thee.  16:27. For that which could not be destroyed by fire, being warmed with a little sunbeam, presently melted away:  16:28. That it might be known to all, that we ought to prevent the sun to bless thee, and adore thee at the dawning of the light.  16:29. For the hope of the unthankful shall melt away as the winter's ice, and shall run off as unprofitable water.  \n",

      " 17:1. For thy judgments, O Lord, are great, and thy words cannot be expressed: therefore undisciplined souls have erred.  17:2. For while the wicked thought to be able to have dominion over the holy nation, they themselves being fettered with the bonds of darkness, and a long night, shut up in their houses, lay there exiled from the eternal providence.  17:3. And while they thought to lie hid in their obscure sins, they were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfullness, being horribly afraid, and troubled with exceeding great astonishment.  17:4. For neither did the den that held them, keep them from fear: for noises coming down troubled them, and sad visions appearing to them, affrighted them.  17:5. And no power of fire could give them light, neither could the bright flames of the stars enlighten that horrible night.  17:6. But there appeared to them a sudden fire, very dreadful: and being struck with the fear of that face, which was not seen, they thought the things which they saw to be worse:  17:7. And the delusions of their magic art were put down, and their boasting of wisdom was reproachfully rebuked.  17:8. For they who promised to drive away fears and troubles from a sick soul, were sick themselves of a fear worthy to be laughed at.  17:9. For though no terrible thing disturbed them: yet being scared with the passing by of beasts, and hissing of serpents, they died for fear and denying that they saw the air, which could by no means be avoided.  17:10. For whereas wickedness is fearful, it beareth witness of its condemnation: for a troubled conscience always forecasteth grievous things.  17:11. For fear is nothing else but a yielding up of the succours from thought.  17:12. And while there is less expectation from within, the greater doth it count the ignorance of that cause which bringeth the torment.  17:13. But they that during that night, in which nothing could be done, and which came upon them from the lowest and deepest hell, slept the same sleep,  17:14. Were sometimes molested with the fear of monsters, sometimes fainted away, their soul failing them: for a sudden and unlooked for fear was come upon them.  17:15. Moreover, if any of them had fallen down, he was kept shut up in prison without irons.  17:16. For if any one were a husbandman, or a shepherd, or a labourer in the field, and was suddenly overtaken, he endured a necessity from which he could not fly.  17:17. For they were all bound together with one chain of darkness. Whether it were a whistling wind, or the melodious voice of birds, among the spreading branches of trees, or a fall of water running down with violence,  17:18. Or the mighty noise of stones tumbling down, or the running that could not be seen of beasts playing together, or the roaring voice of wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the highest mountains: these things made them to swoon for fear.  17:19. For the whole world was enlightened, with a clear light, and none were hindered in their labours.  17:20. But over them only was spread a heavy night, an image of that darkness which was to come upon them. But they were to themselves more grievous than the darkness.  \n",

      "intercession, in the sedition on occasion of Core.  18:1. But thy saints had a very great light, and they heard their voice indeed, but did not see their shape. And because they also did not suffer the same things, they glorified thee:  18:2. And they that before had been wronged, gave thanks, because they were not hurt now: and asked this gift, that there might be a difference.  18:3. Therefore they received a burning pillar of fire for a guide of the way which they knew not, and thou gavest them a harmless sun of a good entertainment.  A harmless sun... A light that should not hurt or molest them; but that should be an agreeable guest to them.  18:4. The others indeed were worthy to be deprived of light, and imprisoned in darkness, who kept thy children shut up, by whom the pure light of the law was to be given to the world.  18:5. And whereas they thought to kill the babes of the just: one child being cast forth, and saved to reprove them, thou tookest away a multitude of their children, and destroyedst them altogether in a mighty water.  One child... Viz., Moses.  18:6. For that night was known before by our fathers, that assuredly knowing what oaths they had trusted to, they might be of better courage.   18:7. So thy people received the salvation of the just, and destruction of the unjust.  18:8. For as thou didst punish the adversaries so thou didst also encourage and glorify us.  18:9. For the just children of good men were offering sacrifice secretly, and they unanimously ordered a law of justice: that the just should receive both good and evil alike, singing now the praises of the fathers.  Of good men... Viz., of the patriarchs. Their children, the Israelites, offered in private the sacrifice of the paschal lamb; and were regulating what they were to do in their journey, when that last and most dreadful plague was coming upon their enemies.  18:10. But on the other side there sounded an ill according cry of the enemies, and a lamentable mourning was heard for the children that were bewailed.  18:11. And the servant suffered the same punishment as the master, and a common man suffered in like manner as the king.  18:12. So all alike had innumerable dead, with one kind of death. Neither were the living sufficient to bury them: for in one moment the noblest offspring of them was destroyed.  The noblest offspring... That is, the firstborn.  18:13. For whereas they would not believe any thing before by reason of the enchantments, then first upon the destruction of the firstborn, they acknowledged the people to be of God.  18:14. For while all things were in quiet silence, and the night was in the midst of her course,  18:15. Thy Almighty word leaped down from heaven from thy royal throne, as a fierce conqueror into the midst of the land of destruction,  18:16. With a sharp sword carrying thy unfeigned commandment, and he stood and filled all things with death, and standing on the earth, reached even to heaven.  18:17. Then suddenly visions of evil dreams troubled them, and fears unlooked for came upon them.  18:18. And one thrown here, another there, half dead, shewed the cause of his death.  18:19. For the visions that troubled them foreshewed these things, lest they should perish, and not know why they suffered these evils.  18:20. But the just also were afterwards touched by an assault of death, and there was a disturbance of the multitude in the wilderness: but thy wrath did not long continue;  18:21. For a blameless man made haste to pry for the people, bringing forth the shield of his ministry, prayer, and by incense making supplication, withstood the wrath, and put an end to the calamity, shewing that he was thy servant.  18:22. And he overcame the disturbance, not by strength of body nor with force of arms, but with a word he subdued him that punished them, alleging the oath and covenant made with the fathers.  18:23. For when they were now fallen down dead by heaps one upon another, he stood between and stayed the assault, and cut off the way to the living.  18:24. For in the priestly robe which he wore, was the whole world: and in the four rows of the stones, the glory of the fathers was graven, and thy majesty was written upon the diadem of his head.  18:26. And to these the destroyer gave place, and was afraid of them: for the proof only of wrath was enough.  \n",

      "All creatures obey God's orders for the service of the good, and the punishment of the wicked.  19:1. But as to the wicked, even to the end there came upon them wrath without mercy. For he knew before also what they would do:  19:2. For when they had given them leave to depart and had sent them away with great care, they repented and pursued after them.  19:3. For whilst they were yet mourning, and lamenting at the graves of the dead, they took up another foolish device: and pursued them as fugitives whom they had pressed to be gone:  19:4. For a necessity, of which they were worthy, brought them to this end: and they lost the remembrance of those things which had happened, that their punishment might fill up what was wanting to their torments:  19:5. And that thy people might wonderfully pass through, but they might find a new death.  19:6. For every creature, according to its kind was fashioned again as from the beginning, obeying thy commandments, that thy children might be kept without hurt.  19:7. For a cloud overshadowed their camps and where water was before, dry land appeared, and in the Red Sea a way without hindrance, and out of the great deep a springing field:  19:8. Through which all the nation passed which was protected with thy hand, seeing thy miracles and wonders.  19:9. For they fed on their food like horses, and they skipped like lambs, praising thee, O Lord, who hadst delivered them.  19:10. For they were yet mindful of those things which had been done in the time of their sojourning, how the ground brought forth flies instead of cattle, and how the river cast up a multitude of frogs instead of fishes.  19:11. And at length they saw a new generation of birds, when being led by their appetite, they asked for delicate meats.  19:12. For to satisfy their desire, the quail came up to them from the sea: and punishments came upon the sinners, not without foregoing signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness.  19:13. For they exercised a more detestable inhospitality than any: others indeed received not strangers unknown to them, but these brought their guests into bondage that had deserved well of them.  19:14. And not only so, but in another respect also they were worse: for the others against their will received the strangers.  19:15. But these grievously afflicted them whom they had received with joy, and who lived under the same laws.  19:16. But they were struck with blindness: as those others were at the doors of the just man, when they were covered with sudden darkness, and every one sought the passage of his own door.  19:17. For while the elements are changed in themselves, as in an instrument the sound of the quality is changed, yet all keep their sound: which may clearly be perceived by the very sight.  Elements are changed, etc... The meaning is, that whatever changes God wrought in the elements by miracles in favour of his people, they still kept their harmony by obeying his will.  19:18. For the things of the land were turned into things of the water: and the things that before swam in the water passed upon the land.  19:19. The fire had power in water above its own virtue, and the water forgot its quenching nature.  19:20. On the other side, the flames wasted not the flesh of corruptible animals walking therein, neither did they melt that good food, which was apt to melt as ice. For in all things thou didst magnify thy people, O Lord, and didst honour them, and didst not despise them, but didst assist them at all times, and in every place.  That good food... The manna.  \n",
